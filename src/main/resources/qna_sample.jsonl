That's a fancy way of saying that, technically speaking, you can only import files exported from other Confluence sites.\nHowever...\nYou can engineer a tool / script that would convert a Zooming XML export into something that Confluence can digest (been there, done that with a different source tool).\nMaybe somebody already wrote something similar.\nThe success of this depends on how uniform is your Zoomin content. I've been thru a lot of migrations and NONE was perfect and EACH required a massive preparation phase followed by massive sanitation post migration phase.\nFor one-off migrations, the fastest way proved to be good old fashioned copy/paste method from a static HTML site (whether generated from Zendesk, MadCap Flare, or Paligo) into Confluence.\nIt's a lot of copy pasting for 2000 pages. But it's not as hard as it sounds. I had an intern who moved 450 pages from an old documentation site to Confluence in 6 weeks working part time. Then he spent about a month on sanity check - which you'd have to do anyway.\nSo at the end of the day, it's a trade-off between spending time on engineering a one-off tool or just doing it manually.","comments":[{"author":"Paul Rathgeb","body":"Thanks @Kristian Klima .

{"question":{"author":"Aliaqbar Husseni","title":"Linking issues from parent project to child project","body":"Hello,\nI am trying to setup the development of a hardware product on JIRA. The parent product is a box which has boards and a sensor (which is a child project). We want to use JIRA to track bugs so whenever an issue/bug is raised the relevant team is notified. For the boards I have added them into the components within the parent project and assigned a leader who looks after any issues on them. But for the sensor which is a different project (child) in itself I cant find a suitable way to track issues. Essentially for the sensors what I would like to do is to raise an issue in the sensor project (child) using the board of the parent project (box).\nThe template I have used is Scrum and company managed project for the parent project.\nCould you please suggest me how to do this/or if there is a better way of doing this."},"answers":[{"author":"Hans Polder","body":"@Aliaqbar Husseni ,\nIf I understand you correctly, you want to create an issue in the Sensor project based of a ticket that was originally created in the 'Box' project? Does it always start there? Would it be a manual action from someone to create that ticket for the Sensor project?\nMy first thought would be to create an Manual Triggered Automation Rule that would be able to handle this. But, keep in mind that Automation executions for the Free version are very limited- So if this is what you need, you might have to consider paying for the Standard version which includes more Automation Rule executions.\nOnce you've shared some more details, I would be able to help with a more fitting solution. :)","comments":[{"author":"Aliaqbar Husseni","body":"Hello Hans,\nThanks for your prompt response.\nYes you are right! I want to create an issue in the Sensor project based of a ticket that was originally created in the 'Box' project.\nYes the issue will always start from the box project and it would be a manual action.\nCant we try to have the sensor as a component in the box project and when we raise a ticket it shows on the sensor project?\nThanks in advance."},{"author":"Hans Polder","body":"Hey Aliaqbar,\nThanks for the additional information. It doesn't work like you describe. If a ticket is created in project BOX with component Sensor, it will get the issue key of the BOX project (BOX-123), and will therefore not show up in the SENSOR project. You can adjust the filters of a board to only show the BOX project issues with SENSOR components, but that's likely what you've been doing with the other BOX components.\nCan you share a bit more about why you would want to have a separate project for the Sensor, but keep all the other components in the BOX project? I understand the physical 'parent/child' relationship, but I'm wondering what value it adds for you to have it in a separate project.\nRegardless of above, you would still need an Automation Rule to create this 'follow-up' ticket for the Sensor team. In that automation rule, you can copy all kinds of values from the trigger ticket and do a whole bunch of cool stuff that could eliminate manual actions/chances of errors. This Automation Rule would just as well be able to create a follow-up ticket within the BOX project or within the SENSOR project, that hardly matters."},{"author":"Aliaqbar Husseni","body":"The only reason why we want to track the sensor issues separately is because its a completely different project and has its own customers. The box uses the sensors and is a bigger project with its own customers. So its necessary for us to track the sensor issues separately.\nI understand your point about the issue key. Cant we have a board within the box project which is linked to the sensor project. So if we raise a ticket as an epic in the box project its seen as a story in the sensor project with the box key."}]}],"tags":["cloud","jira-cloud","jira-software"],"url":"https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-questions/Linking-issues-from-parent-project-to-child-project/qaq-p/2771729"}

Or, you could also try adding a 'Validator' to the workflow that enables the user to see the status 'New', but when they try to activate it, it will show an error stating that a mandatory field is not filled in yet.\n\nIn the screenshot below I chose the 'Sprint' field as example but you can change this to your custom field as well:"},{"author":"Shani Levi","body":"the issue is that I have validator on \"target sprint\" field in \"new\" transtion and also have automation that transion to \"new\" when fix version is update (I added condition that checked that \"target sprint\" is not empty to prevent errors in the automation).\nbut I need to update the user that the transition to \"new\" not occure becouse the \"target sprint\" is empty.\nsee my automation:\n\n\nThanks Shani"},{"author":"Hans Polder","body":"Hi Shani,\nIn that case, I would add a 'IF-ELSE' condition instead of a regular IF-condition.\nIn the IF-ELSE, you can define a second scenario where:\n- issue type = Feature\n- Status = Backlog\n- Fix-versions = not empty\n- Target sprint = EMTPYIn this case, you can add the action to add a comment tagging the initiator (=the person who set the Fix version field) that the 'target sprint' still needs to be filled. I think this is the best solution for your use case, but it cannot involve a popup in that case."}]},{"author":"Rilwan Ahmed","body":"Hi @Shani Levi ,\nWelcome to the community !!\nNative jira does not have this feature.

In a default Scrum project, you'd have: Epic (has SP) ---- Story (has SP)\n---------Subtask (does not have SP) Of course, your Jira project might be configured some other way, and maybe the team is doing some non-standard estimation practice. Common pattern: Epics are estimated in some other unit like T-Shirt size, way before they come up for work. Then you split the Epic into Story items with help from the team, and estimate each story in Story Points. At that point, you might want the Epic to show the sum of the stories' SPs so you can plan an iteration/sprint. Then during sprint planning, the team creates a bunch of sub-tasks needed to achieve the stories. Those are usually estimated in hours/days or not at all. If you give more info about the current state and your agile process and goals, I might be able to help more.","comments":[{"author":"Trudy Claspill","body":"Hello @Antonio Daniel\nAdding to what John said, if you are using Story points as your estimation, the burn down charts will not burn down based on completion of subtasks. They will burn down only based on completion of the parent issues.

{"question":{"author":"Jessica Rubeo","title":"Automate Log Work from Issue Transition Trigger Not Working","body":"Hi all! I'm working on an automation for auto work time logging that uses three separate fields in JIRA; two custom (listed below) and one native (Work Log).\nThe two custom date/time picker fields are \"In Progress Start Time\" and \"Done Time\". I have two separate automations that are triggered by the \"Issue Transition\" trigger that prints the {{now}} variable to the \"In Progress Start Time\"/\"Done Time\" fields when an issue is transitioned into \"In Progress\"/\"Done\". These two automations are functioning as expected and the date/time is being printed properly.\nMy third automation is also being triggered by an \"Issue Transition\" from any status into the \"Done\" statuses:\n\nI added a delay because I often get this error readout:\n\nAnd I figured it was because the automation is running too quickly and the \"Done Time\" timestamp automation doesn't have enough time to register before the Work Log one runs, but this hasn't seemed to fix anything. I know the work log action works properly because if I then change the issue status from \"Done\" to \"Canceled\", for example, it accurately logs the time between the \"In Progress Start\" and the \"Done Time\" date/time picker fields.\nIt seems as though the automation is running too quickly for the Work Log action to function correctly, but I've reorganized and tried adding delays and whatnot; nothing seems to be working.\nAny help would be very much appreciated!"},"answers":[{"author":"Trudy Claspill","body":"Hello @Jessica Rubeo\nWelcome to the Atlassian community.\nI believe the problem is in the smart value you have used in your Log Work step.

But this approach is very limited and will only create the project with shared configuration schemes (workflow, issue type scheme...) but will not recreate project elements, automation rules and issue structures.\nWhen it comes to automation rules, the native approach to use automation rules among multiple projects would be changing the scope to 'global' or 'multiple projects'. Note: Atlassian restricts the amount of cross project usage based on which Jira plan (Free/Standard/Premium/Enterprise) you are using.\nIn many cases, putting the automation rule on global scope is too much, and 'Multiple Projects' setting comes with the limitation of having to manually add the new projects after creation.\nSince you are not alone in the need to reuse project as pattern/template for new projects and many are stuck with the nativ limitations mentioned above, we've built an marketplace addon that aims to tackle as much as possible for an easy project setup.\nProjects Template for Jira\nThe app allows to built custom project templates based on existing projects or predefined elements.\nReuse schemes, but additionally most of all the other project elements as well if intended. (Components, Version, project category, Issues with hierachy and links, project role actors, project- lead/description/url and much more)\nSadly when it comes to automation rules, Atlassian has only recently started providing API support but not yet sufficient enough to clone rules or even add projects in the rule's scope. The only option that comes to mind is, creating a custom project template with a specific project category, setting the scope to global and use an if condition directly after the trigger to see if the project that the automation rule was triggered on matches the project category.\nHopefully Atlassian soon provides more APIs for automation rules, so we can at least include it in the project templates of the app.\nFeel free to follow up if you have any questions @Marcelo Canaparro","comments":[{"author":"John Funk","body":"Hi @W_Diehl _Litew8 GmbH_ - Is this an AI generated answer?"},{"author":"W_Diehl _Litew8 GmbH_","body":"Hi @John Funk\nThanks for the compliment, I guess that means my non-native English is somewhat alright?

{"question":{"author":"Natasha Richardson","title":"Find linked issues of linked issue","body":"I am trying to find the linked issues of a linked issue and check the status and then transition them.\nI have a Manual trigger that closes an issue and then a branch to check the FOR Linked issue of type \"blocks\" and close any child related tickets on that linked issue. That linked issue also has linked issues of \"relates to\" type but I can't get to it to check. I can reach the Child tickets of the linked ticket but not the linked issues of that linked ticket. I have tried using the related issue condition for sub-tasks and linked issues.\nAlso open to other ways of achieving this. TIA."},"answers":[{"author":"Bill Sheboy","body":"Hi @Natasha Richardson -- Welcome to the Atlassian Community!\nRules do not support nested branching, and so a workaround for your scenario is:\n- once inside of the branch on the linked issues of the trigger issue...\n- use the {{issue.issuelinks}} smart value and list filtering / conditions to check the linked issues of those onesHere are some references to help with those techniques:\n- To help understand the smart value structures, view an example issue with this how-to article: https://support.atlassian.com/cloud-automation/docs/find-the-smart-value-for-a-field/\n- To learn about filtering the list of values in {{issue.issuelinks}}, please see this article: https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Automation-articles/Filtering-smart-value-lists/ba-p/1827588\n- To learn the available inline and other conditional logic, please see this documentation: https://support.atlassian.com/cloud-automation/docs/jira-smart-values-conditional-logic/Depending upon the criteria you need, this may be complicated to implement. I recommend first testing without any issue updates, and instead just write to the audit log.

Yes 28312 is the firstLevelLinkedIssueKey and 28311 is the secondLevelLinkedKey so it's finding the correct issues but for whatever reason the smartvalue condition check is referencing 28312 when it should reference 28311 from the lookup.

I am going to just link the issue I need to the issue I am running the manual automation against and then check the status from there."}]},{"author":"Carla Ann Rowland","body":"Looks like you need another branch to check for related issue link -- it will probably be best to separate them the rules. Your 1st rule takes the first level of children that are block.\nBut to set the criteria again to look at the children of the linked tickets I think the logic cannot handle it.\nI suggest: linked issue you just closed based on criteria above had a rule:\nIf linked issue is block by is closed then if sub-tasks exist then close them.

{"question":{"author":"Wynand Meijer","title":"Confluence for user documentation","body":"Good morning everyone,\nI've got a question that I'm not sure has been answered yet. Partly, yes, but not completely.\nSo I want to use Confluence for our end-user documentation. I know I can give users access to this documentation by giving them guess access, or by making the documentation public and giving them the link. This would make the end users \"anonymous users\" as they're called.\nHowever, there are issues with both. First, the anonymous users route would mean the documentation would be publicly accessible, and we don't want that. We want the documentation to be behind a login or at least in some way controlled.\nSecond, the route going with the guest users seems to limit us to 5 guests to one paid users. This is a problem because I'll probably be the only user using Confluence.

Is that correct? Also, did you use the 'Terminology' feature in Jira Admin System Settings to apply any changes already?","comments":[{"author":"Digvijay Singh Gehlot","body":"Hi @Hans Polder\nThank you for your message.\nI have JIRA data center QA environment with version 9.4.20.\nI am able to create a new level of hierarchy above Epic as Initiative and linked it with an issue type as Intake Request.\nLater, I looked for \"Terminology\" option in Jira Admin System Settings and could see that Sprint(s) and Epic(s) are defined there. But I would like to ask, is there any impact of Terminology option when configuring a custom Hierarchy Level?\nAfter creating a new custom level as Initiative and placing it above Epic, I am able to link it with a specific project and it's Issue Type scheme, Issue Type Screen scheme, etc.\nNow, I have further concerns as below:\n- Earlier, I was using a Standard Issue Type (where I have not defined it as Epic/ Feature/ Task/ Sub-task in Advanced Roadmaps) in the specific project.\n- With that Standard Issue Type, I was able to create an issue with custom fields and once the issue created, I was showing the values of custom fields present in that issue on Dashboard.\n- Now, when I changed the Standard Issue Type with the Initiative, and creating a new issue, the issue is not reflecting on the Dashboard. (Blank values are showing under Custom Field columns although the values are present in Custom fields)\n- I have done all the necessary checks like updated the Issue Type scheme, screen and issue type screen schemes, field configurations, update issue filter for Dashboard gadget \"Filter Results\", etc. but I am still not able to see the issues created with Intake Request (linked with Initiative level).\n- However, values in system fields are appearing on Dashboard like Summary, Description.Could you please guide me where exactly I am making the mistake when creating a new level as Initiative above the Epic and then using it in specific project as I am not able to show the values of custom fields (created with Initiative) on the Dashboard?\nPlease let me know if you need any additional details.\nThanks"},{"author":"Hans Polder","body":"Hi,\nThanks for your elaborate reply!\n- The Terminology is related since you have a layer below Epic. So, I was curious to learn if you used this function, or not.

The current idea is that projects should generally be created as company-managed to ensure standards are followed. In this setup process, I have been struggling to keep an overview of the necessary steps among all the options for screens, schemes, fields, issues, and so on.\nIs there a step-by-step guide on how to set up a company-managed project standard layout, including customized issues, what information is displayed in issues, workflows, possibly other important information and how to activate these for a project/set them as default?

{"question":{"author":"Sean Campbell","title":"How to look up values in a field in another issue type to use as drop down field options for custom","body":"I have an instance with 6 Issue Types, there are common fields that are in all, most or some of each Issue Type. For Example, I have a field called:\nOEM Name\nThis is in all Issue Types, but the OEM Name data is input first in the Customer Issue Type as this Issue Type is created first. Since I already have the OEM Name, in all other issue types that have the OEM Name field, I would like to do the following:\nCreate a Custom Field called OEM Name, as a pick list field. But the field options would use a LookUp query to get the OEM Names in Customer Issue Type OEM Name field (which is a Single Line Text field in the Customer Issue Type).\nThis way when users need to update the OEM Name in all other Issue Types, the pick list options show all of the OEM Names that have already been added to the Customer Issue Type record set.\nMy JIRA Team is not sure how to implement this, but I have seen questions that are similar for automatically updating Custom field values based on LookUp. This would execute the same as the Assigned Field when choosing who to assign an issue. You would begin to type an OEM Name and it would show you all the OEM Names in the Customer Issue List record set that match the letters being typed.\n\nThanks in Advance.\n\nSean"},"answers":[{"author":"Thomas Opiolka","body":"Hi Sean,\nI'm not entirely sure if I've understood your use case completely, but from what I understand, the \"External Data for Jira Fields\" app might be a fit for your needs.

And so the order of the subtasks will be based on how they exist within the parent issue: the ORDER BY has no impact.\nAdditionally, JQL has no GROUP BY syntax, as would an SQL, to simplify the groups.\nTo do what you asked, the parent issue and subtasks need to be returned at the same level within the JQL result, allowing the ORDER BY to apply to all of them together.

Here's how you can approach this automation using different tools:\nUsing Jira-\nJira provides powerful automation features that can be used to automate tasks such as adding labels when a sprint is closed.\nNavigate to Project Settings: Go to the project where you want to set up the automation. Automation Rules: Go to Project Settings > Automation. Click on Create Rule. Create a New Rule: Trigger: Select Sprint Completed as the trigger. Action: Select Edit Issue. Edit Labels: In the action configuration, set the label you want to add to the issues in the sprint. Save and Enable: Save the rule and ensure it is enabled.\nHere's a detailed step-by-step:\nTrigger: When the sprint is completed. Condition (optional): Add any conditions you might need. Action: Edit issues > Add labels.\nUsing Trello-\nFor Trello, you can use Butler (Trello’s automation tool):\nOpen Butler: Go to your Trello board. Click on Automation. Create a New Command: Choose Calendar or Due Date. Set the trigger for when a sprint ends (you might need to manually set the end date for sprints). Add an Action: Action: Add a label to all cards in the sprint list. Save Command: Save and enable the automation.\nUsing GitHub-\nIf you're using GitHub Projects, you can use GitHub Actions:\nCreate a Workflow: In your repository, go to Actions. Click on New Workflow. Set Up Trigger: Use a cron job or a specific event that signifies the end of a sprint. Define the Action: Use the actions/labeler GitHub Action to add labels to issues or PRs.\nExample Workflow:\nyaml\nname: Add label when sprint closes\non: workflow_dispatch: schedule: - cron: '0 0 * * 0' # This runs every Sunday, adjust as necessary\njobs: add-label: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - name: Add Label uses: actions/github-script@v3 with: script: | const issues = await github.issues.listForRepo({ owner: context.repo.owner, repo: context.repo.repo, labels: 'sprint-ending', // Adjust based on how you track sprint end }); for (const issue of issues.data) { await github.issues.addLabels({ owner: context.repo.owner, repo: context.repo.repo, issue_number: issue.number, labels: ['sprint-closed'] }); }\nThese steps allow you to automate the process of adding labels when a sprint is closed, ensuring consistency and saving time.","comments":[{"author":"João Ribeiro","body":"Hi @Julio Herrera\nThanks for the quick reply.

You can then use filters like \"project = XYZ and component = <subteam component>\" to filter out only issues relevant for that team.\nYou could also try looking into the 'Teams' functionality where you can create Atlassian-wide Teams, and also fill this information on issue level, and then use filters like 'Team = <id of the team>' for your board.

The solve might just be managing Epics really well, and creating a Confluence page that is roll up of all the different Epics and underlying tickets. I *think* Confluence has a feature that allows a dynamic breakdown of Epics/underlying tickets but I haven't fully checked yet.

I would always favour a custom field or something like this, when you are asking people to indicate where a problem is, how important something is that they want. With labels, of course it is possible to add more information to a context, but at the end of the day, they are very difficult to report on, as people can and do make mistakes when they are typing and create multiple labels that mean the same thing and so on.\nPlease can you explain in more detail what you are trying to use the labels for?

Anyone can help me with what is wrong with\nMy JQL?:\ncategory = 'XXX' AND issueFunction in portfolioParentsOf(\"category = 'XXX' AND \\\"Program Increment (AA)\\\" = AAXX\") AND issuetype = Business Area AND (\"Attribute As\" is EMPTY OR \"Attribute B\" is EMPTY) AND statusCategory != SomeValue"},"answers":[{"author":"Samuel Gatica _ServiceRocket_","body":"Hi @Louis\nTo achieve the desired result in JQL, you need to create a more complex query that includes subqueries and aggregates the issues correctly. JQL itself doesn't support grouping and ranking directly within the query, so you might need to use a combination of JQL and external tools like Excel or a reporting plugin in Jira.\nHowever, I can help you refine the JQL to get all issues (user stories and tasks) with empty values in particular columns and related to their parent \"Business Area/Capability.\"\nHere's an approach to get you closer:\nFind all low-level issues (user stories and tasks) with empty fields. Include the parent information in the results. Since JQL doesn't support direct grouping or ranking, you may need to run these queries separately and then process the results externally.\n*Step 1: Find all low-level issues with empty fields To find all user stories and tasks with empty \"Attribute A\" or \"Attribute B\" fields within a specific category and program increment, use the following JQL:\ncategory = 'XXX' AND \"Program Increment (AA)\" = AAXX AND issuetype in (Story, Task) AND (\"Attribute A\" is EMPTY OR \"Attribute B\" is EMPTY) AND statusCategory != SomeValue\n*Step 2: Include parent information To get the parent information for these issues, you can use a reporting tool or a Jira plugin that supports advanced JQL functions, such as ScriptRunner.\nIf you have ScriptRunner, you can extend the query to include parent information. Here's how you can do it:\nissueFunction in issuesInEpics(\"category = 'XXX' AND \\\"Program Increment (AA)\" = AAXX AND issuetype = Epic\") AND (\"Attribute A\" is EMPTY OR \"Attribute B\" is EMPTY) AND statusCategory != SomeValue\nThis query finds all issues in Epics that match the criteria. However, it does not directly group or rank the results.\n*Ranking by count of issues per Business Area For ranking and grouping, you would need to export the results to a tool like Excel or use a Jira app that supports advanced reporting, such as eazyBI.\nJQL has its limitations in terms of grouping and ranking directly within queries. For more complex reporting, consider using dedicated Jira reporting tools or plugins. The refined JQL provided should help you get the list of issues with empty fields and their parent Epics, which you can then process further in a reporting tool.\n\nHope this helps.\nBest regards\nSam","comments":[{"author":"Louis","body":"Hi Sam. Thank you very much. This type of answer is exactly what I was looking for. Im new to JQL and trying to understand its inner logic, strenghts and weaknesses, so this really helps me understand why it was not so easy.. I come from an Oracle background with SQL and PL/SQL and thinking it should be easy to just pull out all the data you need from all levels of the hierarchy and then group and sort it.. After having read your text, I will try to find out which reporting tools we have in our toolbox. Not sure if script runner is one of them, but we have an integration to PowerBI. I guess PowerBI can do the job, but I'm (naturally) eager to get as close to the data and native toolset of Jira (JQL and what may exist) as I can...

That is, \"In Progress\" time of an issue opened on Friday at 5 PM and closed on Monday at 9 AM, will be a few hours rather than 3 days.\n- You can set different duration formats.\n- You can export reports in CSV file format and open them in MS Excel.\n- You can also add this app as a gadget to your Jira dashboards and reach “Status Time” from Issue Detail page.\n- You can enable/disable access to Status Time reports&gadgets and Issue Detail page per project, users, groups or project role.For further details, you can have a look at Status Time Reports How to Videos.\nIf you are looking for a completely free solution, you can try the limited version Status Time Reports Free.\nIf you have any questions, feel free to schedule a demo with us.\nHope it helps.","comments":[]},{"author":"Gizem Gökçe _OBSS_","body":"Hello @Naven Kumar\nIn order to calculate the time taken by each assignee I suggest you use a 3rd party app. For this purpose I can recommend Timepiece (formerly Time in Status) app, the oldest and leading Time in Status app in Atlassian Marketplace, which is built by my team at OBSS. It is available for both Jira Cloud, and Data Center.\nTimepiece mainly allows you to see how much time each issue spent on each status and on each assignee.\nAssignee Duration or Assignee Duration per Status reports which shows how much time each assignee spent on each Status. These reports show a list of issues by default so you can see the metric values for each issue separately. Please refer to the screenshots below.\n\nThe app calculates its reports using already existing Jira issue histories so when you install the app, you don't need to add anything to your issue workflows and you can get reports on your past issues as well.\nTimepiece reports can be accessed through its own reporting page, dashboard gadgets, and issue view screen tabs. Visit Timepiece (formerly Time in Status) to explore and enjoy a 30-day free trial to experience the full range of features.\nIf you wish, you can also schedule a live demo.

You can try creating a more specific user group with specific guests for that purpose.\nAlso, there might be space management apps in the Marketplace that would allow you to apply restrictions en masse.

Als dat een standaard issue type is dat zich op het niveau onder epics bevindt, is er geen enkel probleem en worden doelen gewoon weergegeven onder de epics waartoe ze behoren. Ik kan mij voorstellen dat dat wellicht niet het geval is en dat doelen zich op een hoger niveau bevinden dan Epics. In dat geval kan je ze inderdaad niet weergeven in de standaard tijdlijn van je Jira project, maar wel in Plans, de plannings-app die inbegrepen is in Jira Premium.\nZie dit support article voor meer informatie.\nTenslotte zou het nog kunnen dat de doelen waarnaar je verwijst geen issue type zijn, maar de Goals die sinds enkele maanden beschikbaar zijn in Jira. Ook die kan je zichtbaar maken in een Plan. Ik verwijs graag naar deze Community post van eind 2023 voor meer toelichting.\nIk hoop dat je hiermee verder kan!","comments":[{"author":"Alaca, Kubra","body":"Hi Walter,\n\nHet is een issuetype doel (Safe OKR).

Daarvoor moet je eerst en vooral over Jira Premium beschikken, vervolgens ervoor zorgen dat je issue type hierarchy geconfigureerd is met de gewenste levels boven epics. Daarna kan je een plan maken waarin je je doelen en onderliggende epics en andere epics inlaadt om ze vervolgens te visualiseren.

Check that the browser is set to accept cookies and does not clear them on exit, as cookies are crucial for maintaining session information.\n- maybe is a browser configuration issue. Make sure the default browser is correctly set up in both the operating system and the email client (Outlook). Sometimes, the email client might use a different browser if not configured properly.

This issue arises when we set the html and body elements to 100% height in our CSS, which we need to ensure the app content properly fills the screen. Instead, the iframe content initially loads at less than half the screen height and then starts expanding without limit. Looking at the developer tools (inspect), I can see that the Iframe height is increasing infinitely.\nDetails:\n- CSS Setup: We attempted to set the height of the html and body elements to 100% to make the content fill the screen. We also tried setting the body height to 100vh. Both approaches resulted in the iframe height expanding infinitelyHere is the CSS used:\n2. JavaScript for Handling Iframe Resizing:\n- We included the all.js script from Atlassian to handle iframe resizing.\n- Added a script to dynamically include the all.js file and call AP.resize() function to adjust the iframe size.Here is the JavaScript we used:\n\nHTML Structure:\n- Our HTML structure in the Handlebars template (main.hbs) is as follows:\nCurrent Behavior:\n- When the app loads, the iframe height starts at less than half of the screen height.\n- As soon as we set the html and body height to 100%, the iframe height starts expanding infinitely.\n- Setting specific pixel values for height prevents infinite growth but doesn't achieve the desired responsive design.Community Insights:\n- Has anyone experienced similar issues with iframe height expanding indefinitely in Confluence apps?\n- Are there any recommended approaches or best practices for handling iframe resizing in Confluence apps?\n- Could there be any specific configuration or settings we might be missing that could resolve this issue?thank you for any help."},"answers":[{"author":"Jessica","body":"Hi @Sal Mourad\nWelcome to the Atlassian Community!\nFrom the description, since Custom CSS is not available in Confluence Cloud, I believe you are trying to create a custom Confluence app or a custom Confluence macro.

I followed the documentation very carefully and ensured the payload i am sending is valid. I seem to get errors of \"Status name is not unique\".

This would be fine, if the workflows didn't reference the statuses via statusReference, that from what i can tell, can only be provided to the workflow bulk create request.\n\nIt means that any workflows expecting to use the Jira default statuses cannot be created the the API because these statuses already exist.

You can also create a Jira agile board based on a filter that includes tasks from multiple Jira projects, so you can plan and track the entire cross-department project in one single place.\nAnother approach would be to have one single project in Jira for all departments and use a field like Components or Team to assign a task to each department.\nHope this helps.\nDanut.","comments":[{"author":"John Bradley","body":"Hi @Danut M _StonikByte_ ,\nThank you for the reply, this is very helpful.

When I started (about 16 months ago), we were using the Free Cloud plan, since I was basically the only one using Confluence and we could add a few reviewers while still on free.\nThe plan was that, once the documentation was ready to roll out to the rest of the company, we would move to the Standard plan, with licenses for all who needed to access the guide.\nThis brought up the question of how to update pages when needed in the future without all those end readers seeing the changes before we were ready to publish them.\nOver the course of a year of participating in this community (thank you community for all your wisdom! 😀), I learned that there are 3rd-party apps that we could use to provide a website output that we could make available to our internal folks (you can also set it up for external readers).\nIt turns out that licenses for the 3rd-party app we chose for our people who will actually use Confluence for other purposes are much cheaper than getting Standard licenses for all the people who just need to read the documentation, so we decided to go that route.\nHad I known up-front that we were going to do this, I could have avoided the hours and hours I spent figuring out how to work around some of the features in Confluence to format my docs how I wanted, as well as putting in features like TOC macros on each page that I now do not need (because my app provides alternatives or doesn't support some of the macros and features I used, and I am now spending time removing them.)","comments":[{"author":"Nikki Hylton","body":"This is super helpful - thank you @Barbara Szczesniak !

{"question":{"author":"JS","title":"Integrated Roadmaps and Dependencies","body":"Hi -\nAs an overview, I am standardizing some reports for a group that has 12 Product Lines. Each Product Line has 10-15 teams under it, each working on a scrum framework. The Product Lines use Milestones and MVIs as issues types. The teams use Epics and Stories. Each Product Line has it's own Jira project. The teams within the Product Line share a Jira project. They are linked using the parent link.\nI am trying to build an integrated Roadmap showing the MVIs for all the product lines as well as a dependency report that spans all 12 product lines. The dependency reporting in Jira Roadmap/Plans view is not feasible as it's pretty cumbersome. I need something executive level.\nI have both Tableau and PowerBi as options. I'm not skilled in either.\nAny thoughts? It's a lot of data (about 100 teams working on two week sprints).

Even though teams use the same issue types, they may use them in different ways. Teams may also indicate dependencies differently.\n- Since you have a lot of data and a lot of teams, it's a good idea to focus on a very narrow subset of your final report and see if you can create that manually. This can clarify what you want and helps figure out what's feasible Even a limited report is enough to get feedback from stakeholders without investing a lot of time up front This also captures how data flows from Jira into the final report, which can be useful when building out the full report\n- You'll probably need to write some code Even if you end up using PowerBI or Tableau, what you describe sounds like it will need a data conditioning step Also talk to a PowerBI/Tableau expert in your company.

Para proyectos administrados por la empresa (no proyectos administrados por el equipo), puede crear tipos de problemas personalizados en el Nivel -1.\nCon el plan de suscripción Premium, que las etiquetas de tus publicaciones indican que tienes, puedes agregar niveles de jerarquía por encima del nivel Epic. Lo haría creando nuevos tipos de problemas inicialmente en el Nivel 0, luego, en una pantalla Jerarquía de tipos de problemas, movería ese nuevo tipo de problema a un nuevo nivel por encima del Nivel 1.\nTenga en cuenta que cuando observe los gráficos de Burndown integrados, estos utilizarán los problemas en el Nivel 0 para calcular el Burndown. Los problemas del nivel -1 no pueden existir independientemente de un problema principal del nivel 0.\nHay una funcionalidad especial asociada con el tipo de problema integrado de Epic que se encuentra en el nivel 1. Si bien puede agregar otro tipo de problema en el mismo nivel, la funcionalidad especial asociada con el tipo de problema integrado de Epic no se aplicará a ese problema adicional. .\nHay algunas formas de ver la jerarquía de incidencias ampliada.

For Company Managed projects (not Team Managed projects) you can create custom issue type at Level -1 .\nWith the Premium subscription plan, which your post tags indicate you have, you can add hierarchy levels above the Epic level. You would do that be creating new issues types initially at Level 0, then in an Issue Type Hierarchy screen you move that new issue type to a new level above Level 1.\nNote that when you are looking at the built in Burndown charts those would be using the issues at Level 0 for calculating burndown. Issues at Level -1 cannot exist independent from a parent issue at Level 0.\nThere is some special functionality associated with the built in Epic issue type that is at Level 1. While you can add another issue type at the same level, the special functionality associated with the built in Epic issue type will not be applied to that additional issue.\nThere are some ways to view the extended issue hierarchy. It would not be visible in the native agile boards (scrum and kanban).

Retrieve the data once and filter the results and store those in lookup tables.\nIn my automation rule, I am doing a lookup using the following JQL:\nTo avoid running multiple lookups for the same data, I am using a lookup table to store the values. This is working as expected when storing the data for the sprint:\n\nThe next challenge was to use the same lookupIssues data and filter the results by status and store the number of issues and sum of the Story Points for the issues that match my criteria. Similarly, I am storing those values in a lookup table.\nI have tried numerous routes and have added to my collection of gray beard hairs.\nThere may be more, but some smart value conditionals were deleted with the fury of a thousand suns.\nUsing multiple JQL lookups to filter the results and store the values. Here is one of the 8 lookups I am doing:\n\nThis was my first approach and it works, but I did not like that it was calling the same data set multiple times, pushing the maximum number of components in my rule, and taking over 20s to run. Not ideal. That is when I had the idea to get the data once and try filtering the result from my first JQL lookup.\nI created a new rule and kept the first lookup issue step where I returned all of the issues in the current sprint. At a loss of how I would be able to select the issues whose status matches those above, I tried the simpler ask of getting the story points and count for the issues that have the RTB component.\nIn my tblRTB I have a key of storyPoints and its value is:\nThis did not return any values when I logged the key (using size or sum).\nThen I tried a different conditional for my storyPoints value:\nThis did not yield any values again.\nThere are probably 20 other options I tried, but before I give up and go back to Option 1, I thought I would reach out for help.

Confluence can export data as HTML, XML, PDFs, Word... there are apps that can make much better PDFs, export to markdown...\nI guess the issue here is extracting - uploading to ILM (not sure about the specifics of that) - and the subsequent download/readability of the page by end users.\nIf you want to run the Confluence export file thru another services, we're on a the content migration ground and that's a whole new level of complexity.\nYou can export individual pages as docs/pdfs (and other formats) and make them available elsewhere.\nBut I guess you could do this via API - connecting two environments - extracting the pages from Confluence and processing them (and making them available) in your target environment. For example, there's an app that allows you to publish confluence pages to Zendesk.

Those don't apply to Jira Cloud, but your other tags indicate that this is a question about Jira Cloud.\nCan you clarify/confirm if this question applies to Jira Cloud or Jira self-hosted, and which third party apps you have available in the environment.\nIn the end, I don't think there is a way to satisfy your requirement if those are the only JQL extension apps you have available and you are using Jira Cloud. I tried to work through the problem and ran into limitations.\nThe more complicated portion is:\nshow \"Non software\" issues that are linked to \"RC\" and that \"RC\" that are linked to \"Non software\" shouldn't have a link type \"is fixed by\"Working from the RC issues back to the \"Non software\" issues:\n1. Get RC issues that have no \"is fixed by\" links\nproject=CH and issueType=RC and not jqlt.links.type = \"is fixed by\"\n\n2. Get RC issues that have a link to \"NOT\"/\"Non Software\" issues\nproject=CH and issueType=RC and jqlt.links.project = \"NOT\" and jqlt.links.issuetype = \"Non Software\"\n\n3. Get the RC issues that meet both those criteria.\nproject=CH and issueType=RC and jqlt.links.project = \"NOT\" and jqlt.links.issuetype = \"Non Software\" and not jqlt.links.type = \"is fixed by\"\n\n4. Get the \"NOT\"/\"Non Software\" issues that have links to the RC issues that are within #3.\nThis is where we hit a wall. There is no way to take the query from #3 and use it as input to get the \"Non software\" issues.\nproject=\"NOT\" and issuetype=\"Non software\" and linked-issues-of(query from #3)\n\nWith another app like Adapativist's Enhanced Search you can embed filters in some functions:\nproject=\"NOT\" and issuetype=\"Non software\" and issueFunction in linkedIssuesOf(\"filter='query from #3' \")\nlinkedIssuesOf() is a function that returns the issues linked to the issues specified by the filter in the parentheses. So, the filter from #3 get you the list of qualifying RC issues. linkedIssuesOf would get all the issues linked to those RC issues. Combining that with the rest of the filter reduces the list to only the \"Non software\" issues from the \"NOT\" project that are linked to appropriate RC issues from the CH project.\nI don't know, though, if it would actually work to embed into linkedIssuesOf() a filter that include JQL Tricks keywords.\n\nThe final part of your requirement is simple, if I understood it correctly.\nIn you post you said:\nalso show \"Non software\" issues with link type \"EMPTY\"Do you mean the \"Non software\" issues that have no links to other issues? Or do you have a link type that is named \"EMPTY\"? Assuming you mean issues that have no links, that is relatively easy with JQL Tricks:\nproject=\"NOT\" and issueType=\"Non software\" and jqlt.links.count=0\n\n\nDisclaimer: all of the above is based solely on reviewing the JQL Tricks documentation.

I'm guessing that the issues are in a Company Managed project, because in a Team Managed project setting the Resolution field is usually handled automatically by Jira, without any intervention by users or custom configuration by administrators.\n\nFixing this is going to require assistance from a Jira Administrator in the case of a Company Managed project. The Workflow needs to be modified, and usually that can be done only by Jira Administrators.\nIf you want to attempt to set the Resolution field for issues resolved in the past and also try to set the Resolved Date to a date in the past, that will also require help from a Jira Administrator who would create a CSV file with the necessary information and use the External System Import function to import that file and update the existing issues."},{"author":"Centro de Comando","body":"Hi Trudy,\nI work with Jhomilton and I'm one of our Jira Administrators.

It is possible that the workflow transition to Resolvido was changed around that time, or the Resolution was set during the transition the issue was in prior to being set to Resolvido.\n\nTo fix the problem going forward you need to look in the workflow for the issue type(s) where the status is green/Resolvido and there is no value for Resolution.\nYou need to examine all the transitions to the Resolvido status and check the Post Functions for those transitions. They need to have a Post Function for setting the Resolution field.

It would be quite difficult to create an actual new status as like I mentioned their board visualizes multiple issue types from various projects and that would be a major change.\nIs there a workaround for this?\nMany thanks!"},"answers":[{"author":"Tim Kopperud","body":"Hi @Spasimira Genova, if I understand you requirements correctly you will not be able to do this. A board column is mapped to one or more statuses. You cannot have tow columns using the same status.\nI had the same requirements a few years ago, and we solved it by adding the status, but the transition to this status was only visible for a specific team hence other teams did not relate to this status at all.\nIf this is not an accepted solution for your requirements (I understand it is not), then the following workaround might help.\nUse a field (lables, resolution or customfield) to mark the issue \"Rejected\" (or something), then in your board, filter out all issues tagged as Rejected. If you need to see them for a while on the board, include a time limit in the filter for these issues. You might also define a dedicated card color for these issues and a quick filter for hiding them.\nTimK.","comments":[{"author":"Spasimira Genova","body":"Hi Tim,\nThank you for your reply!\nWe have decided to go with the second workaround you've described - turns out all issues from these project share a status called 'Cancelled'.\nWe will create a label 'rejected', and a quick filter for the UX writing team's board that shows tickets with this label.

Thanks for accepting the answer.\nTimK"}]},{"author":"Lucas Lombardo","body":"Hello!\nI found myself in a similar situation (a board displaying several issues from different projects with different statuses).\nIn my opinion, if you create a \"rejected\" status, the most important thing is that this status should be mapped to the appropriate columns on each board. For example, if the UX team sets a ticket to \"rejected\" it can be pushed to the \"on hold\" column in another team's board (although it will still have the rejected status).\nIf you use this new status, teams that have never used it will see this status as \"unmapped\" by default in their configuration board, and unfortunately I don't think there's any other option but to ask each board owner to map this status with the appropriate column.\nThe last possible option, which will also depend on what you want to do with rejected tickets, is to create an automation so that rejected tickets become cancelled, but I imagine that these tickets will wait in a backlog?\nGood luck, I hope this helps :)","comments":[{"author":"Spasimira Genova","body":"Hi Lucas,\nThank you for your input!\nThe first option is going to be too complex to implement for our current ways of working.

{"question":{"author":"Andy Meadows","title":"Adding Guest User to Single Team-Managed Project","body":"My Jira project has this nice \"Manage Roles\" section (see screenshot) where I can create a custom role and give it specific permissions, and then I can assign it to a specific user. From a configuration perspective, this appears to be fantastic and SO much easier than what I've tried to do (unsuccessfully) with the permission schemes.\nUnfortunately, it doesn't seem to work. Am I doing something wrong or is it really this difficult to add an outside user to a single project? I have added a user to that new role and assigned the role permissions, but the user does not receive access until I add them as a user in Jira and then they get access to all projects and not just the single project as a guest.\nThis new UI seems like a very straightforward way to configure a new group and assign specific users to that group, but I must be missing a step as it seems to have no impact.\nNote: I verified this is a Team-Managed project. The user in the example has been added to Jira, but has not been given access to Jira (we only have User and Admin options).

Transitions can have Conditions that have to be met before the transition is available. In that case you may see that you can move one ticket back but not another that is the same Issue Type.\nThe only way to address either of these causes is for somebody with the appropriate permissions to modify the workflow.

Your user could create such a relationship between two issues without actually executing the Split function. They could also remove the established link between two such issues.\nSo that is four events so far that might prompt you to want to recalculate the sum.\nIt is also possible that one issue could be split, and then one of the issues created from that split could be split again.

Williams\nWelcome to the Atlassian community.\nDo you get any notifications from Jira? If you get any at all, then your email is not blacklisted.\nThere are multiple factors that affect the notifications you receive.\nEach project is configured to send notifications based on events, to specified users/groups/roles. For the notifications you are not receiving, perhaps the project doesn't send notifications for those events, or it is not configured in a manner that the notification should be sent to you.\nAdditionally there are your own personal settings for notifications. Those will not make Jira send notifications to you beyond what is configured to be sent by the projects, but it does allow you to tell Jira that there are notifications you don't want to receive. Click on your avatar and review the Notifications settings to see if those might be excluding some of the notifications.\nIn Jira Cloud you can set your personal Notifications settings with a default configuration, and then also override that with settings specific to a project.

{"question":{"author":"Katherine Nji","title":"Confluence space Export and Import","body":"I am trying to export and reimport a confluence space from one instance to another. I tried the CSV export since they are both cloud instances . However, on countless times when I go to reimport the file on the new instance, it gives me an error message, it starts unzipping the file and half way through it says the import has failed. I tried using another approach by exporting to XML. I exported some selected pages of the space and reimported just that file and it worked. It created a new space on the new instance so I moved the information and deleted that space. Now I am trying to export other pages and the import crashes 1/2 way through and I get this error message. Also, when I do the entire space XML export , I immediately get a failure message when I hit import. The entire space export is about 81,600 KB"},"answers":[{"author":"Kristian Klima","body":"Hi @Katherine Nji\nYes, your experience is correct as you can only import XML space exports.\nIf I get it right, you exported a couple of pages from space A from Confluence 1 and imported those pages to Confluence 2.\nThe reason your second import to Confluence 2 fails is that there is already a space in your C2 with a space key A.\nEver Confluence space has a unique space key. There can be no two spaces with the same key on one Confluence site and, before you ask, you cannot change a space key.\nSpace key is a part of any XML export AND import.\nBy importing the first batch of pages, you created in your C2 a space with the key of Space A. As you second export/import carries the same space key, it fails.\nYou say that you deleted the imported space from C2 ... but did you removed it from the space trash?\nAnyway, if I run into multi-stage import issues, I usually do one of the following:\nWorkaround 1\n- Delete the original import from C2 (delete and purge from Trashed spaces).\n- Export the entire Space 1 from C1 and import it to C2.Workaround 2\n- On C1, create a new space - space B.\n- Using an app like Copy Page Tree or other method, copy the remaining pages of Space A into Space B.\n- Export Space B from C1 and import it into C2.\n- On C2, using the app or other method, copy the pages from Space A to Space B (or the other way 'round.I'd go with the first method which will preserve all links between the pages within Space A and assures that permissions and other metadata are preserved across the space as whole.","comments":[{"author":"Katherine Nji","body":"Hi @Kristian Klima , Thanks for your response. Option 1 looks like a better option but each time I try importing the entire space into C2. I get an error right way. The file gets uploaded successfully but doesn't import when I click on import.

I tried the basic session on the automation, but it doesn't solve my problem. How can I build a JQL that would solve this problem?"},"answers":[{"author":"Trudy Claspill","body":"Hello @Camilla Braganca\nDo you mean you want to set the Due Date on that issue to be 3 days before the first Friday of the month?\nHow far in advance of that date do you want this card created?\nLet's say you want the recurring task created 2 weeks before it is due. And if it will be due 3 days before a Friday that means it will be due on a Tuesday. So, create a rule that runs every Tuesday.\nIn that rule you could add a condition to check if day on which it runs is 2 weeks + 3 days before the first Friday of a month. If it is, then you want to create the recurring task.\nTo determine if that date 17 days from the Tuesday is the first Friday of the month, check that its day-of-month value is less than 8. (The first Friday could have dates 1 through 7, with the date being 7 if the first day of the month was the previous Saturday.)\n\nIf that condition passes, then it is the right time (2 weeks in advance) to create the new task.\nSet the Due date for the task being created to 14 days from the date the rule is running.\n\n\nLets run through some examples, using this month (July).\nIf the rule ran on Tuesday the 2nd, 17 days from then would be Friday then 19th. 19 is not less than 8, so that Friday is not the first Friday in the upcoming month.\nIf the rule ran on Tuesday the 9th, 17 days from then would be Friday then 26th. 26 is not less than 8, so that Friday is not the first Friday in the upcoming month.\nIf the rule ran on Tuesday the 16th, 17 days from then would be Friday then 2nd. 2 is less than 8, so that Friday is the first Friday in the upcoming month.\n- Create the task. Set the due date to today (16th) plus 14 days, making the Due date July 30th. That is three days before the first Friday of August, which is August 2nd.\nYou can keep running through examples to prove to yourself that the recurring task would be created correctly, 2 weeks in advance of the first Friday of the month.","comments":[]},{"author":"Fernando Eugênio da Silva","body":"@Camilla Braganca , Welcome to the Atlassian Community!\nI believe that what you actually need is to use a CRON expression in your Scheduled trigger automation.\nIn Scheduled you can use advanced CRON expressions to get closer to the scheduled execution you expect.\nThis cron expression for example will run every first Friday of each month at 12:00 PM: 0 0 12 ? 1/1 FRI#1 *\nIf you are not confortable with cron expressions you can use a Cron Maker site to help you, like this one: http://www.cronmaker.com/?1\n\nHope this helps you :)","comments":[]}],"tags":["cloud","jira-cloud"],"url":"https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-questions/Recurring-card-scheduled-for-3-days-before-the-first-friday-of/qaq-p/2766079"}

{"question":{"author":"Daniel Pfeffer","title":"Move Task types from a \"Team managed\" to \"Company managed\" Project?","body":"Hello out there\nWhen I move Issues from a Jira project of the type “Team managed software project” to a project of the type “Company managed software project”, information from the issues is lost because the issue types in the “Team managed” project are not available in the new project.\nIs it also possible to transfer the task types used to the “Software project managed by the company”.\nIf so, how?\nI look forward to advice from the community.\nBest regards\nDaniel"},"answers":[{"author":"Dave Mathijs","body":"Hello @Daniel Pfeffer\nThat is behavior \"by design\" unfortunately and one of the many reason I don't recommend using team-managed projects as specific configuration is not \"shared\" across the platform.\nTeam-managed projects and company-managed projects are technically quite different. Here's a few things to consider when you migrate from a team-managed software project to a company-managed software project:\n- Board statuses: If you customized your team-managed board, you'll need to set up the same statuses in your company-managed project's workflow. Only Jira admins can create and modify statuses and workflows. Learn more.\n- Custom fields: If you use custom fields in your team-managed project, a Jira admin needs to recreate the fields and add them to screen schemes and field configurations in your company-managed project. Custom field data will need to be recreated, otherwise it will be lost.\n- Issue types: If you added your own issue types to your team-managed project, you'll need to have a Jira admin recreate these using an issue type scheme that they associate to your new company-managed project. Learn more.\n- Project access: Access to company-managed projects is controlled by a permissions scheme. Only your Jira admin can update your company-managed project's permission scheme. Learn more.\n- Project and issue keys: Jira will automatically update the issue keys of migrated issues to reflect their new project. Any existing links to old issue keys will be automatically redirected.\n- Reports: Reports data won't be saved. Even though your issues will be retained, data for your project's Velocity and Burnup reports won't transfer over, and will be lost.\n- Story points estimation: This data will be lost. This is because the custom field that Jira uses to store estimates in company-managed projects (Story points) is different to the custom field used in team-managed projects (Story point estimate).","comments":[{"author":"Daniel Pfeffer","body":"Hello @Dave Mathijs\nThank you very much for this comprehensive answer.\nI suspected it would be like this, but I was hoping there might be a trick after all.\nWe also only work with “company managed” projects, but we still have a few “sins” from before."}]}],"tags":["cloud","jira-cloud"],"url":"https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-questions/Move-Task-types-from-a-quot-Team-managed-quot-to-quot-Company/qaq-p/2765777"}

With the Kanban boards you can use the Clear Done Issues option to clear the done column.\nWith Scrum you create a time-boxed Sprint and add to the sprint only the work that you are committing to completing within that time period. At the end of the time-box you specified, you use the \"Complete sprint\" button to tell Jira you are officially ending the sprint. Jira will pop up a message telling you how many issues were completed and how many were not. It will ask you what you want to do with the incomplete issues - put them back into the backlog or add them to another sprint.\nWith the Scrum methodology you keep making time-boxed sprints, adding work to them, completing the work and closing the sprints.\nSo, the question you need to first answer is do you want to be using the Kanban methodology or the Scrum methodology for this project?\nFor a Team Managed project you can switch between them by disabling or enabling the Sprints option under Project Settings / Features. When the option is disabled the board works in the Kanban manner. When the option is enabled the board works in the Scrum manner.\nIf you want to change to Kanban for this board, change the Sprints option. Then you will get the Clear Issues option in the Done column.\nIf you want to keep working in the Scrum manner, then you will need to use the Complete Sprint button to end the sprint and clear the Done column.

While this request appears to be a standard query request on the surface, there are some details that warrant closer scrutiny. Specifically, an unusual string pattern in the query parameters suggests the possibility of a particular type of attack: SQL injection.\nAttack Type: SQL Injection\nRisk Level: High\nRequest Payload (code block):\n\n\n\nPayload Intent:\nIn the aforementioned request, the key malicious payload is found in the URL's query string: cql=type=space%20and%20space.type=favourite%20order%20by%20favourite%20desc. This portion is URL-encoded and, when decoded, becomes cql=type=space and space.type=favourite order by favourite desc.\nPayload Intent Explanation:\nThe attacker might be attempting to exploit the target application's SQL query handling vulnerabilities by inserting additional SQL statements into the query parameters. In this specific case, the payload aims to modify the original query logic, potentially bypassing certain filtering conditions to access more unauthorized data or to execute more complex database operations, such as modifying or deleting data.\nIt's important to note that SQL injection is a common attack method that allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL statements on the target database, leading to severe consequences such as data leakage, data tampering, or service disruption. In this scenario, the attacker might be trying to obtain sensitive information related to \"space\" or exploring the database structure to further exploit other vulnerabilities.\nTo prevent such attacks, applications should rigorously validate and sanitize all user inputs, use parameterized queries or prepared statements, and limit the database account's permissions. This ensures that even if SQL injection occurs, the attacker cannot perform highly destructive operations."},"answers":[{"author":"Andy Heinzer","body":"Hi @dada\nFrom reviewing this, I don't believe there is any clear evidence that this is a SQL injection route. Confluence is using it's own search/query language known as CQL, but this should not be confused with SQL. From what I can see I believe the analysis here is incorrect. Just because a user could make a get request to change the CQL payload of the GET request, it doesn't actually mean that Confluence would execute any SQL commands passed to it as a result. It might run a CQL search, but this endpoint doesn't have the ability to change data like a SQL command might potentially be able to do.\nBut if you have further concerns or questions on this topic, I would invite you review our page in https://www.atlassian.com/trust/security/report-a-vulnerability as we have several better locations for reporting potential vulnerabilities than our public community forum.\nCheers,\nAndy","comments":[{"author":"Michael Andreacchio","body":"Hi @dada\nAs a followup to @Andy Heinzer's comment I'm just noting that we've gotten our internal security team to test the SQL injection attempt noted above.

The user must right-click with the mouse over the misspelled word and select the correct word.

To do that you would need to go to the Sprint Report to find that sprint and reopen it. But that alone will likely not solve your problem.\nAn issue can't be in more than one active sprint at a time, and I'm not sure what Jira would do if you tried to reopen that sprint when it's issues are already in an active sprint.\nAt this point it may be better to continue with the current sprint and see what happens when you start the Completion process. If you have the flexibility to pause the completion of the current sprint, then I recommend you do so, so that the state of the system at that moment can be reviewed.\nI would suggest that you look at the sprint report for the previous sprint and see in which group your previously done issues are listed. They should've been listed in the Issues Completed in Sprint section. If they were not, that problem needs to be investigated, but you may have to wait until you are ready to end your current sprint to see if the problem occurs again. If it does, then before starting another sprint the problem should be investigated more.\nIt would also be a good idea to let your Jira Admins know about this issue. If it becomes necessary they can open a support case directly with Atlassian. Then, with you admins' permission, Atlassian engineers could connect directly to you system to look at the data.\nHere we are a community of users. We can offer you debugging tips, but we can't access your system directly.

{"question":{"author":"Randy O_Neal","title":"Users restricted to a space, can they access Smart Linked content?","body":"OK, I'm pretty sure I know the answer, but I have to ask. I have a communal space, and I have a contractor group who only have access to that space. My question is this: if I post a smart link to a document in another space, will my contractors be able to access that document? I'm guessing no.\nI'm trying to limit their access to only the one space, but there are some documents in other spaces which the contractors need to access. I wound up copying one document over to their space so they can have access to what they need, but I need to provide some other documents as well, and I hate, hate, hate making copies of the documents.\nWhat is the best solution here? I'm guessing the smart links won't be available to my contractors... any advice would be greatly appreciated."},"answers":[{"author":"Kristian Klima","body":"Hi @Randy O_Neal\nPermissions will be a blocker. HOWEVER, there is a workaround, actually TWO workarounds, that do not require manual copy paste of content. And you will not need smart links for COnfluence Content.\nWorkaround 1\nUsing Space Sync for Confluence allows you to sync content from multiple spaces into another space. So you can have one target space to which you push content from your source spaces. The app has per-space permission levels, so you can ensure that the sync is one-directional.\nWorkaround 2\nProviding the contractors only consume the content, you can use Scroll Documents and Scroll Viewport apps to do the following.\n- Use Scroll Documents to create Documents - think of them as virtual documents = any section of a space that you define. So you would have a section/entire space A as Document 1, a section of space B as Document 2.\n- Then, using Scroll Viewport, you built a doc center/website where Document 1 and Document 2 would be your content sources.\n- You restrict access to of the Viewport site to your contractors (via your company's SSO or via token - both features come standard with Viewport).\n- SSO ensures that your contractors will be able to access linked/embedded content that they have access to via SSO.\n- Every time you update the content in your spaces A and B, you simply rebuild the Viewport site.Viewport site is completely independent from Confluence (permission wise), so you can have your cake and eat it (depending on the specifics of your use case) - your contractors will not need a seat on Confluence.

Do you have a list of which ones were added, dropped or changed during the switch?"},"answers":[{"author":"Marc Koppelaar - Devoteam","body":"Hi @Perbility\nWelcome to the community.\nJira DC is basically the same as Jira Server, the option that is added based on the license is you can have multiple Jira front-end instances connect to the same backend DB.\nThis to spread the load, if this is required.\nYou can also just have a single instance running, with the DC license.","comments":[{"author":"Radek Dostál","body":"That plus plugins are generally \"compatible\" on 1:1 basis with data center, as it uses the same codebase/API behind it.\nThere are some nuances to this due to the clustered environment, that is partly why apps are tagged as \"data center compatible\" on the marketplace - an initiative that the plugin developers must take to get approved and ensure none of their code will misbehave in the cluster. For the most part, usually, there isn't really any difference, the main aspect is clustered/background jobs and caching, since previously they would just run once on the server, could be cached in memory and not care about any cluster, but now you could have 2+ individual nodes where such jobs would run, unless the developer makes sure it only runs once on one node only (i.e. \"per cluster\", rather than \"per server\"). Same with caches, which now typically should be visible across the cluster, not just a single server.\nEntirely dependent on what the individual plugin does and how it works. If you have doubts then just check if your custom apps are all data center compatible, and if not, you can always reach out to their vendor to check with them if there is anything you should be concerned about or if they are planning to get dc compatible. It's entirely plugin-specific."},{"author":"Perbility","body":"Hi.\nThank you very much for your quick reply. It is a single instance. It's not about plugins that we already have in use.

{"question":{"author":"Kelly Elizabeth Hutchison","title":"Setting my 3 active whiteboards","body":"I have lots of whiteboards set up, but since the rules on whiteboards have changed , now a lot of them are view-only. This is fine for the most part when I need to refer back to something, and occasionally I see a popup when I open one asking if I want to swap it to be active, which is great, and I can activate it again.\nSo, this is in fact what I want to do. But if I don't see the popup appear asking the question, I don't know where to go to manage which whiteboards are my three active ones. I am opening a whiteboard, and I don't get the popup, only a band across the top stating this is view-only. So where do I go in my settings to manage which whiteboards are active at any one time?\nThank you"},"answers":[{"author":"Jehan Bhathena","body":"Hi @Kelly Elizabeth Hutchison\nFrom other community posts I think it isn't possible to 'Activate' a selective whiteboard.\nhttps://support.atlassian.com/confluence-cloud/docs/understand-confluence-whiteboards-plans-and-features/ this doc provides more details.\nPassage that might be relates to your use case :\nIf you exceed the three active board limit on the Free or Standard plan, your last three created boards will remain active. Any additional boards will become read-only, allowing you to view and access existing information but not make edits. This ensures you can keep working on your most important projects while managing your board usage efficiently.Given this situation, I've requested Atlassian to help clarify this behavior.","comments":[{"author":"Kelly Elizabeth Hutchison","body":"Hi Jehan,\nThanks so much for responding. I just don't understand because sometimes, only sometimes, when i go into an older whiteboard, a popup appears and it says 'This whiteboard is view-only. Would you like to activate it and make 'xxxx other whiteboard name' view-only instead?'. And I can select 'Yes' and then the whiteboard is active again to continue editing. It's just that this popup does not consistently appear each time I open a view-only whiteboard. If the popup was consistent then it would be perfect, I could just switch between active whiteboards whenever I needed to edit something on an older board.\nProducts change and evolve ALL THE TIME. So when I go back to an older process flow chart whiteboard with a new addition to the process or a change to the flow making it more efficient, it makes no sense that I have to re-create the entire whiteboard again to change one little part of the process. That is not efficient development."}]}],"tags":["cloud","confluence-cloud"],"url":"https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Confluence-questions/Setting-my-3-active-whiteboards/qaq-p/2744372"}

{"question":{"author":"Patrick Wright","title":"How to track products?","body":"Our organization has many teams and even more products. Teams work on more than one product. A product may be worked on by more than one team. After researching for a while, I've seen most people recommend that a separate JIRA Project be created for each team.\nI am trying to figure out what the best way to handle the linkage between issues on which a team is working (e.g., epics, stories, tasks) and the particular product(s) to which they relate. My requirements are:\n- It is easy to add new products across all teams\n- Ideally no custom field needs to be addedI was thinking that perhaps the Components field could be used for this purpose. A new component would be created for each product. As others have noted, the downside is that Components are project-specific. But, I found the Octo extension which seems to solve that problem. You can also then create different Fix Versions for each product and associate the components to these versions.\nDoes it make sense to use the Component field in this way? Has anyone else needed to solve this type of problem?\nIs there a better way to track work on products when different projects are used for teams?"},"answers":[{"author":"Vronik","body":"Hi\nAnswering this question is complicated from the perspective that each person uses it according to their needs. Personally, I have found the component field very useful, also the use of labels, version numbers and of course the Octo extension can be very useful if you have many things to group. It would be good to think about which of all the options is the most generic to avoid having to have several solutions to the same situation or having to make different customizations. I would recommend the components and labels as a first option, but before making the decision, make an assessment of the impact, the coverage of the solution and that nothing is left out or is an exception.","comments":[{"author":"Patrick Wright","body":"And I'm not entirely sure what our needs are. Right now, we are tracking products in a very poor way (via a custom field that never gets updated so most people put a default value).\nMy current idea is as follows.\nUse a hierarchy of components for product families, products, etc... For example, suppose my company works on two product families: Laptops and Cellphones. Under the Laptops, we make 3 models: LT123, LT456, LT789. Under the cellphones, we make 2 models: CP14, CP2000.\nIn JIRA, I would create components named: \"Laptop\", \"Cellphone\", \"LT123\", \"CP14\",... then use Octo to organize the hierarchy correctly.\nI would use Fix Versions to manage the releases of the various products. For example, Fix Version \"LT123-MVO1\" would be the release for the first \"minimum value offering\" of the LT123 laptop.\nI believe that, with this structure, it is easy for the developers to assign their work (epics, stories, tasks) to the associate products. Also, since the Components field allows multiple values, developers can work on a single item that affects multiple products. For example, if a story affects a common piece of hardware used in both our laptops and cellphones, I could assign the \"LT123\" and \"CP14\" component to it. If the change effects both product families, I would assign the \"Laptop\" and \"Cellphone\" components.\nDo you think this workflow/architecture will be successful?"}]}],"tags":["cloud","component","jira-cloud","product-management"],"url":"https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-questions/How-to-track-products/qaq-p/2763514"}

Without that association of historic sprints to issues your Sprint Reports would change.

I can create the issue in separate automation rules, but then I don't have a good way to reference back to the issues.\nAnyone built anything similar to this? Do I need to use a third-party app?

{"question":{"author":"Sherman, Christopher R","title":"Atlassian Databases: Attachments Links Display Text (or Embedded Attachments)","body":"Hello Atlassian Community,\n\nHere seeking some assistance with the Databases utility. Our use case is that we use Confluence as a source of truth for certain business activities and templates to be used (largely .doc, .xls, .pdf) in the completion of these activities. These templates live in multiple Confluence pages within attachments macros.\nWe've been exploring the use of Atlassian Databases to better manage our attachments and attributes pertaining to them. We want to use the \"Link field\" Database field type to link back to the attachment, and allow people to download it from the database. However, the link field is displaying the attachments full URL, instead of the desired link Display Text. And these lengthy URLs are taking up valuable visual real estate and lose context we can provide with a display name.\nHas anyone found a workaround to this problem? I see the Link field does support display text when you link a Confluence page, not the case though for attachments.\nAn alternative approach could be embedding the attachment in the database but there is no current field type to support this, and I'm unclear what's on the roadmap for this new utility (Databases).\nThanks in advance to anyone who can provide help!"},"answers":[{"author":"Kristian Klima","body":"Hi @Sherman, Christopher R and welcome to the Community\nIt's possible ;)\nYou just need to put the attachment in an excerpt macro.\nThen, in Database, use page link as you main column, then page details - excerpt.\n\nI wrote an article on DB tips and tricks, you may find it useful.","comments":[{"author":"Sherman, Christopher R","body":"Kristian, thank you very much for your quick response! We've been working with this solution and see that it works very well. Within the Excerpt we are able to add the link and change the link display text to what we desire. We can hide the page links and rename the page details column to something more easily understood for people using the database. We also experimented with putting the attachment in the excerpt and even an attachments macro - the results were not as desired as the attachment icon needed too much space and the attachments macro delivered a lot of contextual attachments detail in the field where we only wanted the attachment name and link.\nWe are continuing to face a problem though. Our use case involves having a master database where we perform all of our maintenance, and then linked databases in various confluence pages used for display and delivery purposes where we apply filters to show only the master database content that's applicable. The linked database field for the page details never displays the attachment link. It's a perpetual gray oval, as if the database is trying to make the link and display the correct content but cannot do so. This is likely a bug and we will report it.\nAny other suggestions from the community to get attachment display text in linked databases?"},{"author":"Kristian Klima","body":"@Sherman, Christopher R\nLike this?\nI'm using the Embed Database macro and it displayes the excerpt just fine but...

And all entry details columns are pulling details from master fine (tags, descriptions, etc), except for the excerpt attachment column, where this perpetual gray \"loading\" oval comes up where the links should be.

{"question":{"author":"Tedd Shimp","title":"Can I use google sheets (or something else) in my automation rules?","body":"Background: Currently, I have 50+ automation rules in place. Each of these rules, when triggered, attaches 3 labels to a newly created Jira issue type based upon a drop down selection (in this case, it's a drop down of 50+ clients; whoever creates the Jira issue chooses 1 client for whom the issue is being created). In other words \"If client = A, then edit issue with label 1, label 2, label 3\"\n\nExample: If \"Client A\" is selected, the automation attaches 3 labels indicating 3 key items for us: For examples: \"Joe\" the client's manager's name - but it's NOT the assignee of the issue, \"June\" the month that the client onboarded to our company - this is done for billing purposes, and \"Medium\" the client's risk - this is a label and NOT the standard RISK field in out of the box Jira.\n\nProblem: From time to time the client's manager will change or the client's risk will change. This requires us to then go into the automation rule itself and change the label(s) that will be attached to the issues the next time the automation is triggered. \"One-offs\" aren't that bad (Example, \"Client B\" changes from low to high), but when/if a client manager leaves our company or their role, that will require us to shift clients around to other managers. This can lead to 20-30 automation rule changes as we shift clients from one manager to another...\n\nQuestion: Is there a way that I can simply have a sheet serve as a database so that when any client is selected, the rule will reference the labels that are listed on the sheet for that client? Or, is there a better way to simplify our label assignments?\n\nOutcome desired: We want a faster and scalable way to update/change our label assignment rules. If we can employ a sheet (or something else) as our \"database\" then we could simplify our rules by simply updating the sheet when a client's labels need to change."},"answers":[{"author":"Marc Koppelaar - Devoteam","body":"Hi @Tedd Shimp\nYou could look into API related options if you have another system where you can store this information and that is able to make API call or receive the so Jira can retrieve the data and store it to the issue.\nThere might be marketplace app you could look into.\nOr upgrade your Atlassian Cloud to Premium and use Assets, that is simply said a DB/CMDB option where you could store such information into a scheme.\nI hopes this will provide you into a direction that would fit your needs.","comments":[{"author":"Tedd Shimp","body":"@Marc Koppelaar - Devoteam , that is a good explanation of my options.

{"question":{"author":"Dan Ny","title":"How to search for issues with a change in description?","body":"Background information\nMy team works on two Jira instances: our clients' Jira instance and our internal Jira instance. As for our clients' Jira instance, we usually collab with our clients to create issues and keep track of changes in the issues while we use our internal Jira to keep track of project timelines and -- which is not done on our customers' Jira.\nOur customers' Jira instance is set rather differently than ours. And we export the issues from our customers' Jira then import them to ours (with the help of our python script).\nAs mentioned above, we make changes to the issues on our customers' Jira instance when we discuss with them and we don't usually export the change right after each meeting (because there are usually more meetings after and so on). So, we tend to do it once a week. So, when we want to export the issues that we made changes especially to the description, we do not know which issues.\nOur workaround\nWhat we do so far is: we search for issues with updated >=-7d (updated within the last 7 days) then we have to gothrough each issue whether there is any change in the description field. Then export them to our Jira instance. This is a time-consuming and inefficient task.\nQuestion\nIs there a better way to search for issues with the changes in description?\n\nThanks in advance!"},"answers":[{"author":"Yuliia_Borivets__SaaSJet_","body":"Hi @Dan Ny\nAs JQL doesn't support history searches for the description field, I might suggest a workaround solution developed by my team.

I have been trying to figure out why pie chart doesn't show our custom field, that we are adding via custom plugin. Its a multiUser selector field, but with some added logic. And when selecting it in pie chart diagram, it doesn't show all data. It kinda works the opposite way. If I select my field, it shows results for none. So where our field is empty. I can see that jira fires a rest call to: jira/rest/gadget/1.0/statistics?jql=*** And it returns only the none value, not like it does for jiras built in field type. I have two of those pie charts on, so i see two rest calls, and one is configured to use default jira multiUserPicker and one is our custom picker. And I can see that it returns wrong json from that rest call. But I cannot find anywhere any documentation, about that rest api. Why It would return incorrect results, what could be the problem, or any kind of information. What is the procedure to find out what jira does on that rest api and why it cannot find my field ?

As all of the macros provided by the Table Filter, Charts & Spreadsheets for Confluence app are compatible, you may wrap each Table Spreadsheet macro in the Table Excerpt macro and then collect your excerpts on the master page via the Table Excerpt Include macro\n- If you need to reuse any cell ranges from different sheets of the Table Spreadsheet macro somewhere in Confluence (the reused table won't be editable), you may use the Table Spreadsheet Include macro\n- If the question is how to reuse your table structure, formulas, conditional formatting, etc. while creating a new table, then you may use the following workaround: create the desired table view once and export your file in the .tfss format. This format is a special format designed for the Table Spreadsheet macro that stores everything. You may save this file on you PC. Then if you need to create a new table of the same structure, you just insert a new macro on the page and import this .tfss file.

It is primary used to restore instances than move between server but it is good to try it when you want to change databases (e.g from MySQL to PostgreSQL) or migrate from/to Cloud.\nWhen you physically migrate between servers (e.g want to change infrastructure / OS) you migrate first application just by copying files, than database (you need a database backup) since db data is not stored in CONFLUENCE_HOME and other files (e.g attachments if not in HOME). You need to make sure that configuration of the server is identical.

With the single space approach, you're making it overwhelming and hard to manage (content, user, permission-wise).\n\nIf your KB is extensive, I would go for a multi-space approach for better management. Then you might consider using an app to create a single documentation site that would act as a gateway to the docs for individual products - like Atlassian docs :) built with the app referenced above, but there are many others on the marketplace.\nThis approach would allow for most flexibility (again, permissions, workflows, content management) on your end, while giving the readers (internal or external) to access docs for individual apps, without clutter, while giving the option to move across the apps docs within a unified controlled environment (that is nicer to interact with than stock Confluence).\nHope this will help to evaluate your options.","comments":[]},{"author":"Daniel_Domene_Kolekti","body":"Hi @Patrice Champet , it could vary on the number of users in your instance but, as @Shawn Doyle - ReleaseTEAM recommended, we also go for multiple spaces.

And icing on the cake would be documentation on the admin side of the review so at-a-glance, we can monitor the status of our full library.\nI have played with a handful of macros, but I am hoping to gain insight from anyone who might manage a knowledge base in this manner.\nThanks!"},"answers":[{"author":"Dave Rosenlund _Trundl_","body":"Welcome to the community, @Alyssa Mattson 👋\nConfluence has many great notification features so users can be notified about new content or changes to existing content.

From departmental meetings all the way through to senior management meetings. Most teams meeting agendas have a page, and within it is a task report macro which shows all open action points. This works flawlessly. There are also options to create a task report to show completed items. The configuration options allow to show items 'created after' date, however there is a significant limitation in that there are no options to filter when they were completed by.\nOver time a significant number of tasks are completed by users, and it would be a very welcome addition to be able to create a task report that only shows tasks completed in the last X period. Most teams meetings recur weekly, so being able to show in these meetings all tasks completed in the last week would be highly beneficial.\nBecause of these limitations, users often don't mark tasks as complete until the meeting, or if they do mark them as complete, the fall out of sight so tracking the efforts made in the last week and the tasks that have been completed is not as convenient or as easy compared to showing all open items. The only current option is to include a task report macro showing all-time completed items. Although you can add a completedon column, the sorting of this field is inconsistent and rarely works.\nAre there are any options that I have missed or feature requests already logged to provide this functionality?\nBeing able to filter similar the task report with something like: completedon >= -1w, similar to how both Jira Software and Jira Service Management areas work would be perfect."},"answers":[{"author":"Stiltsoft support","body":"Hi @Chris Davies ,\nThe Table Filter, Charts & Spreadsheets for Confluence app (it's the app that we develop) is compatible with tabular macros.\nSo, you'll be able to wrap the Task Report macro in the Table Filter macro and filter your report by the Due Date (including -1d, -1w, -1m variables).","comments":[{"author":"Chris Davies","body":"Thanks for your suggestion, but I am not looking to filter by due date.\nDoes your app allow to filter tasks by 'completedate'?"},{"author":"Stiltsoft support","body":"If you add completedate to the Columns to display list of the Task Report, then yes.\nThe macro is just a filter that works like a filter in Excel: if the column is present in the source table (manually created or macro generated), then it can be filtered."},{"author":"Chris Davies","body":"Thank you.\nFunnily enough we already use your application.

En el back-end, todo ese tiempo en realidad se almacena como segundos. Para los campos de seguimiento de tiempo, Jira convierte automáticamente ese valor según la configuración de su sistema para horas laborales por día y días hábiles por semana.

When work is logged against a child issue (or a work log is edited or deleted) use an automation rule to catch that activity and then have it sum up all the time logged against child issue and record that in a separate field in the parent Epic.\nThe disadvantage of solution 1 is that if you do reports about time logged then you will get double the amount of time because it is logged against two issues.\nThe disadvantage of solution 2 is that there is no custom field type that will automatically provide a display of expended time in the months/weeks/days/hours format that you see in the native time tracking fields. In the back end, all that time is actually stored as seconds. For the time tracking fields Jira automatically converts that value based on your system configuration for working hours per day and working days per week. You would have to do that conversion yourself if you wanted to sum up the values and store them in a custom field, which would be the method to implement solution 2.\n\nThere may be a third party app that would sum up the values and display them properly formatted.

To create a sub-task, you first need to create the parent issue. Once the parent issue is created, you can add sub-tasks from the issue view.\nHere’s how you can create a sub-task:\n- Create the Parent Issue: Go to your project and create the main issue (e.g., Story, Task, Bug) as you normally would.\n- Open the Parent Issue: Once the parent issue is created, open it from the issue list.\n- Create Sub-task: In the issue view, look for the \"More\" button (usually represented by three dots) or a direct link to \"Create sub-task\". Click on \"Create sub-task\".

Let's dive into the concepts of \"Issue Types\" and \"Sub-Task Issue Types\" to clarify their purposes and uses.\nIssue Types in Jira represent different kinds of work items that need to be tracked and managed. Depending on your project's requirements, you might have a variety of issue types such as:\n- Story: A user story that represents a feature or requirement from the user's perspective.\n- Bug: An issue that signifies a problem or error that needs to be fixed.\n- Task: A general work item that needs to be done.\n- Epic: A larger body of work that can be broken down into smaller tasks or stories.These issue types help in categorizing and managing your project work more effectively. Each issue type can have its own workflow, fields, and screens tailored to its specific needs.\nSub-Task Issue Types are a special category of issue types that are used to break down an issue into smaller, more manageable pieces. Sub-tasks are linked to a parent issue and can be used in various scenarios, such as:\n- Breaking down complex tasks: If a task is too large or complex, you can create sub-tasks to handle different aspects of the task separately.\n- Tracking individual steps: Sub-tasks allow you to track progress on individual steps or components of a larger task.\n- Assigning different parts: You can assign sub-tasks to different team members, allowing for more granular tracking of who is responsible for what.Let me know if this solve your issue."}]},{"author":"bhanu teja","body":"Hi @Rajat Krishnan you cannot create subtask it can be added under story or task","comments":[{"author":"Rajat Krishnan","body":"Hello @bhanu teja\nThanks for quick response, So you mean i cannot add sub-task as a children item with change request?\nThank you"}]}],"tags":["cloud","jira-cloud"],"url":"https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-questions/Sub-task-is-not-visible-under-create-issue-dropdown-list/qaq-p/2761627"}

I am doing this to make the creation of project pages easier for ICs. My page hierarchy looks like this:\nTeam Page (parent page)\n> Project Page 1 (child page)\n> Project Page 2 (child page)\nI have created easy uptake for ICs to quickly create a project page by clicking on a button to create a new page (this button lives on the parent page). In the project page, there are multiple macros and live templates. In one of my sections, \"Project Details,\" I have an advanced table where I laid out a table with the heading on the left and a \"Text Data\" field to its right. For example, Health, Stakeholders, and Status headings are on the left and in the column to their immediate right is the data the IC will fill out. The ask:\nSince my pages are built as templates, is there a way/macro to aggregate information, such as Status, to the Team Page (parent page)? I've tried Excerpt/Insert but I want to automate it so that any time a new child page is created, it can continue to aggregate the information. I can't direct the Excerpt to a label for aggregation, only a direct page, which would be a manual process. I've also tried the Page Properties macro but it seems that it doesn't necessarily work when information is horizontal instead of vertical (headings in a row at the top and subsequent information at the bottom). The Page Properties worked using a label which I liked.\n\nHappy to clarify my ask/project background."},"answers":[{"author":"Stiltsoft support","body":"Hi @Vicky Patel ,\nWe can suggest trying the app that we develop - Table Filter, Charts & Spreadsheets for Confluence.\nThe app provides the Table Excerpt/Table Excerpt Include macros that seem to fulfill your case:\n- The macros collect vertical/horizontal multiple-row tables\n- The aggregation may be by specific page labels or you may automatically collect tables from child pages/from child pages & further descendantsIf you are not familiar with the app, please book a call with our team - we'll show the case live.","comments":[]}],"tags":["aggregation","confluence-data-center","data","data-center","filter","table","table-excerpt","table-filter","table-filter-and-charts","table-filter-charts-spreadsheets"],"url":"https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Confluence-questions/Aggregating-data-from-multiple-Confluence-pages/qaq-p/2736267"}

It is completely free and the limited version of Status Time Reports app.\nThis app mainly provides reports and gadgets based on how much time passed in each status. It also has a dynamic status grouping feature so that you can generate various valuable reports as cycle time and lead time, time in status, time in assignee, status entry dates and status counts, resolution time, average/sum reports by any field(e.g. average in progress time by project, average cycle time by issue creation month).\nHere is the online demo link, you can see it in action and try without installing the app.\nFor further details, you can have a look at Cycle Time and Lead Time in Jira: Productivity Measurement with Two Critical Parameters article and Status Time Reports How to Videos. App Features:\n- You can search issues by Project, Issue Type, Status, Assignee, Issue Creation/Resolution Date(and any other Date field) and JQL Query.\n- Status durations are calculated according to the working calendar you define. Once you enter your working calendar into the app, it takes your working schedule into account too. That is, \"In Progress\" time of an issue opened on Friday at 5 PM and closed on Monday at 9 AM, will be a few hours rather than 3 days.\n- You can set different duration formats.\n- You can export reports in CSV file format and open them in MS Excel.\n- You can also add this app as a gadget to your Jira dashboards and reach “Status Time” from Issue Detail page.\n- You can enable/disable access to Status Time reports&gadgets and Issue Detail page per project, users, groups or project role.If you have any questions, feel free to schedule a demo with us.\nHope it helps.","comments":[]},{"author":"Marcel Sarvaš","body":"Thank you all, I will be trying out the Bloompeak app.","comments":[]},{"author":"Valeriia_Havrylenko_SaaSJet","body":"Hi @Marcel Sarvaš 👋 Check out this tread.

Thanks!\n\nNext, I believe the duration selection of \"2 weeks\" counts from the start with date / time, and so it runs through to the same time for what appears to be the 11th business day: but it is effectively 10 full business days. To force the boundaries to be within 10 calendar business days, please use the custom duration and set the times manually.\nReviewing the date / time values you note for the sprint range, they do span more than 10 working days: 19 July 2:30 AM to 2 August 11:30 PM. To be within 10 days, the end time would also be 2:30 AM on 2 August.\nI have seen suggestions to make this less confusing in Jira, but the ability to select the start time is the complication: some teams do actually finish at a specific hour on a specific day and start the next sprint one minute / hour later on the same day."},{"author":"Venkata Unnam","body":"Thanks for your clarification.

You would be either triggering one rule to run for every transition or each transition would trigger one of several different rules. You can learn more about how usage is calculated here:\nhttps://support.atlassian.com/cloud-automation/docs/how-is-my-usage-calculated/\nSmart values can be used when you are trying to access some element that does not have a simple/default access option. For instance, as you discovered, within a branch the actions you execute in the branch affect the issue that is \"in focus\" in that branch. The issue \"in focus\" can be access using the smart value {{issue}}. If your rule has no branches, then {{issue}} also refers to the rule that triggered the issue.\nTo get to information that is in the issue that triggered the rule, you can also always use {{triggerIssue}}, regardless of whether you are in a branch or not.\nMany issue fields have different attributes to them. For instance a user identified in a User Picker field, like Assignee, has a name, and account ID, and an email. To get a single one of those attributes you can use a smart value like:\n{{issue.assignee.email}}\nThere is a lot of documentation on smart values available here:\nhttps://support.atlassian.com/cloud-automation/docs/smart-values-in-jira-automation/\n...including details on how to access different attributes of fields, and functions that you can use with smart values, such as getting the difference between two dates.\n\nMost folks getting started with Automation start with trying to use just the default functionality, until they run into something that they can't figure out. Then they start diving into smart values.\nWhen working on an Automation also take a look at the Templates tab. There are some sample automation rules there that might help you figure out how to construct what you want."}]}],"tags":["cloud","jira-cloud"],"url":"https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-questions/When-Issue-transitioned-for-linked-issue-IF-X-then-transition-to/qaq-p/2760882"}

I don't know what developer exactly it will be, but only that I will need him for ten weeks for Epic A. How?\nI tried using BigPicture, but the only way to do that is to create a fake user, which consumes a license, and assigning this user as the assignee of this Epic.

I believe you could achieve it using Jira Plan For Example 1, you could create a team plan only for the developers, allocate a capacity of 80 hours (10 days) to that team, and associate it with the epic.\nFor Example 2, the same idea implies that adding the two teams to the Initiative will consume 50% of each team's capacity.\nYour plan assumes that each team member can work on one story-level issue at a time. With that in mind, it distributes an issue’s estimate based on the capacity of one team member, which it calculates using the following equation, assuming the capacity of each team member is equal:\n- [team’s capacity per iteration]/[number of people in a team] = [capacity of one team member]It consumes one team member’s capacity for an iteration, then moves on to the next team member, repeating the process until the work is assigned.

Navigate to the Access section. Verify if the Project Access is set to Private. If it's set to Public or Company-managed, you may need to change it to Private to restrict access.\n- Review Group Permissions: If you have a group (e.g., Group: A) that is automatically added to new Jira projects, you might want to check if this group has been granted access to the project by default. To manage this, go to the People section within Project settings. Look for the group in the list of users and roles assigned to the project. If you find that Group: A is listed and you don't want them to have access, you can remove the group from the project by selecting the appropriate option next to the group name.By ensuring the project access is set to Private and managing group memberships appropriately, you should be able to control who has visibility into the project.","comments":[{"author":"Dr_Win_ST","body":"Thank you"}]},{"author":"shib saha","body":"Hi Dr_Win_ST,\nConfigure the permission scheme using role and then that role can be assigned to user, group in the people section.

Team Managed projects don't use Permission Schemes that you would see in the Administration / Issues / Permissions Schemes list.\nThe Administrator role and the Member role in Team Managed projects are built in roles provided by Atlassian. You are not able to modify the permissions granted to those roles.\nIf you want to remove the ability to edit all comments from administrators in a Team Managed project then you need to make a new project role in that project for administrators. You can create that role by copying the current Administrator role. Then modify the new role to disable the Edit Any Comment and Delete Any Comment permissions. Then assign all the users in that project that currently have the Administrator role to the new role, and remove them from being assigned to the Administrator role.\n\nAs per this document if your Site Admins are listed under the Administration Access for your Jira product, then they will have the Administer Jira global permission which will give them access to administer projects. I'm not sure that disabling the permission in a new project administrator in a Team Managed project will actually remove the permission for such users. Additionally, withe the global permission to administer project such users may be able to simply reassign themselves to the native Administrator role in TM project and regain that permission.\n\nYour Site Admins should be your most trusted set of administrators. They should know when it is and is not appropriate to leverage these permissions.

I found two answers and I am not sure what is correct yet, the 2nd one is correct but might not be with me require admin approval now for the approved domain;\nFirst, when require admin approval is checked it should still allow users to log in with MS but once they do they will need to request product access. As our SSO provides access to one of three groups and provisions, and then that initial sign in to one of the products provides that product access automatically today to a group that has user access, so I am going to be testing this with someone today, this is the part that I cannot find documentation on. What does the user see when we have SSO enabled, they have no Atlassian account or product access, but log into SSO provider while browsing an Atlassian product like Confluence with the require approval set, so will know hopefully today, the issue with testing is I am super new to the company, I know pretty much no one so far, and of that slim set of people I know already have access, so I am pretty much cold pinging people on MS Teams asking if they have time to help but most are busy with the Crowdstrike outage\nSecond, I am reading in Atlassian documentation that with SSO \"New users automatically have access to your products as soon as they're active, making onboarding new employee's easier.\" - so I am hoping this doesn't override the admin approval requirement under the approved domain.\nSome more details, we currently have 2 authentication policies, one is Azure, one is just local directory, both have basically the same users. I feel this is not how this should be configured, but that is something I will be looking into after this unless it becomes part of the problem, probably have Azure as main with everyone, other with just Org Admins as backup in case Azure goes down. Our SSO is enforced in the Azure policy.\nCurrently has 2 domains, any domain that requires admin access for user role in any product. Our domain that did not require admin access for user role, but I changed this Friday so that it does, and this so far has stopped all emails coming in that say \"X person joined Confluence\" that we were getting daily. The any domain does allow requests for access to products for the user role, this will be another thing I will most likely set to no products.\nI was a site admin prior to this job, this job I am an Org Admin, before I could only see directory in admin.atlassian.com, but now I can see all and I am just learning so much its amazing!"},{"author":"Hans Polder","body":"Hi @Jason Krewson ,\nHappy to see you're so excited about this!

The rule may end up being triggered by the issue to which you linked.\nIf you want a more detailed explanation of that, let me know.\nYou will need to create the rule as a multiple-project scoped rule, specifying the two projects of interest.\nIn your rule you have specified all link types, so the rule may be triggered by the issue in either project. So, you will have to add some conditions to check the Project of the triggering issue, and the Project of the other issue in the linkage. I haven't quite worked out all the details for that yet.\nIs it correct that you would not want the label applied if the link was created between two issues in the same project?\nIn which of the issues do you want to add the label?

The linking is done while \"standing\" any other projects.In my example I will label the issues on project MOBL, and only if the other project is FAC.

{"question":{"author":"Natalia Bakos","title":"Version creation seems to try to create the same version twice","body":"Hi,\nI'm writing an automation which triggers an automated version creation and release. The trigger is coming from a webhook.\n\nAs you can see it creates a version then it releases it. The \"If\" part is not necessary, since I can't use smart values in the project setup, I added this to make sure that the release will be created in the correct project.\nThe \"Create version\" step behaves very strangely.\n1. When I leave the project in the \"Create version\" step as \"Same project\" it creates 2 releases for me, one unreleased without any issues connected to it and one released one (after the \"Release version\" step) with the proper issues connected to it. It's annoying.\n2. When I selected the specific project in the \"Create version\" step it creates only one version with the correct released state and issued connected to it, but in the audit logs I can see an error while everything created properly:"},"answers":[{"author":"Bill Sheboy","body":"Hi @Natalia Bakos\nYour trigger has selected the option, \"Issues provided in the webhook HTTP POST body.\" And so I believe the rule loops to run the steps over each issue, including repeatedly creating the version and trying to release it. Based on timing, that may or may not fail when it collides on the version create / release.\nOne alternative is to:\n- select the incoming webhook trigger option of \"No issues from the webhook\",\n- pass the issue keys in custom data for the request as CSV in the source process, and\n- iterate over them with a single branch on JQL.For example, the incoming data might look like this:\nAnd so the branch JQL could be:\n\nKind regards, Bill","comments":[{"author":"Natalia Bakos","body":"Thank you for the reply.

And so:\n- one of the loop passes creates and releases a version ,\n- a later one tries to creates with the same name as an unreleased one (and fails due to collision),\n- another tries to release by name but finds none unreleased (failing silently),\n- etc.That is because the rule uses the version name attribute (and not the id) in the actions. If the id was always used in the release I hypothesize there could be one released version for each one in the trigger...or more consistent errors in the log."},{"author":"Natalia Bakos","body":"Hmmm, if this is how it works, then it would be really-really helpful if a smart value can be used to select the project when creating/releasing a version. In this current setup the version creation/release can't be generalized, I have to select a specific project, since I can't use the issue's settings.\nBut, I managed to create a working automation considering the info you gave.\nHere's my solution to anyone who is struggling with the same thing.\nThank you for your explanation!"},{"author":"Bill Sheboy","body":"Well done!\nRegarding your comment about generalizing this solution (such as for a global-scope automation rule), the automation Create Version action would not help because it needs some context to select the target project: either rule scope or the issue data.\nA possible workaround would be to use Lookup Issues with JQL to get one of the issues (from the webhook data), and then use the Send Web Request action to call the Jira REST API endpoint to create and release the version for the specific project.

AS 'Initial',\nCASE\nWHEN T1.'Totals' = \"A\" THEN (SELECT SUM(T2.'A') FROM T2)\nWHEN T1.'Totals' = \"B\" THEN (SELECT SUM(T2.'B') FROM T2)\nWHEN T1.'Totals' = \"C\" THEN (SELECT SUM(T2.'C') FROM T2)\nELSE NULL\nEND AS 'Used'\nFROM T1\n\n- Add a Table Excerpt Include that points to tableT2\n- Finally add a Table filter to display both the tables and create filters for Product and CategoryStructure:\n\n\n\n\nNow, the issue! If I want to display the Table Excerpt Include content, I select 'Show a copy...'\n\n\nAnd when I filter on Category for example, only T2 is filtered, the calculation is not processed in T1 :(\n\nIf I untick 'Show a copy...', then 1. I miss the view of that T2 table, 2. the calculation in T1 is processed!!! but it's impossible to remove the filtered value unless you reset the filters.\n\nI must be doing something wrong, but I just can't figure it out.\nReally struggling to get this working.\nI hope someone has a solution :)"},"answers":[{"author":"Stiltsoft support","body":"Hi @Fabrice Smith ,\nSeems that we are talking about the Table Filter, Charts & Spreadsheets for Confluence app.\nIt will be simpler if you refer to our support where you'll be able to attach a page storage format of your page (upper right corner -> menu ... -> View storage format).

Our licensing team assured us that the new plugin would be a like-for-like match and that it would work automatically with our existing Confluence pages once the Comala Metadata plugin expired. However, this has not been the case. Even after manually adding the new metadata macro to our Confluence pages, I’ve noticed that the fields in Metadata for Confluence are not the same as those in Comala Metadata. Can anyone explain if both plugins serve the same purpose and if there are any steps we can take to ensure a smooth transition? Specifically, I’m looking for: 1. Confirmation on whether Metadata for Confluence can fully replace Comala Metadata. 2. Guidance on how to properly migrate existing metadata fields. 3.

If we assign ownership to one person, they have too much responsibility.

So you successfully added A request type to your desired work category called incidents. Then you go and create a new issue that does not show up under incidents. So let's confirm that the issue you created indeed has the appropriate request type. The best way to do this is by using the portal. In this way you bypass having to figure out what issue type needs to be selected when creating from the main menu in JSM. Can you please share screenshots that prove that the issue created in fact should show under incidents. Specifically let's see the screenshot that illustrates the request type under the incident category and a screenshot of the new issue illustrating the same request type."},{"author":"Bruno Siqueira","body":"Hey @Jack Brickey trying to find the information you requested, I could find a missing task on the automation to edit the request type when the ticket is created to assign the correct one.

Anyone have experience of this, and how was it resolved if on an enterprise network where tinkering with security policies is restricted?\nI have done some investigation and the problem is not limited to me just being on our corporate VPN, in fact the issue can manifest on either business or home networks and it is not consistent. Additionally I have ruled out any browser extensions which modify headers etc.\nInterestingly perhaps is that when I use sslchecker to verify the cert it reports a different fate to the one in chrome.\n\nAlso there is no organisation Unit. I am not sure if that is even important at this point, it seems to not be mandatory.\n\"Further, what constitutes a valid OU has been vague and arbitrarily defined by different Certificate Authorities (CAs). It has also been the only non-mandatory standard input field in Certificate Signing Requests.\"\nThe main observation here is the date which seems odd it should be the same, in which case how can it be different. And it is still a valid date so the CERT should be fine.\n\nIt seems that those of us with the issue are being sent to media-cdn.atlassian.com whereas others are going to api.media.atlassian.com, so perhaps we are missing an update in our browsers from the PWA?

When you want the prior edits to be accounted for in the rule, add a Re-fetch Issue action after the edit and before the updates need to be \"seen\". However...\n- The rule has a branch over multiple things Branches which could process more-than-one-thing run in parallel and asynchronously. There is no guarantee of when such branches will complete, up until the last step of the rule. And so the actions within the rule are not additive, and... The branch is likely still running if there are rule actions after the branch.\n- The logic inside the branch seems to repeatedly call the REST API with the Send Web Request action I expect this rule to be both slow and possibly non-deterministic in behavior as a result\nPutting those things together, it is likely the rule is walking over prior issue updates.

Using something outside of the issue (like a project property) is unlikely to work due to update collisions. And, because the branch may not complete before the steps after it start, such a value could not be relied upon.\nThere is an open suggestion to add an option for serial vs parallel, rule processing, which you may watch or vote for to see progress: https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/AUTO-32\nI have seen brittle workarounds using multiple rules, but they rely on forecasting rule duration and assuming no automation outages / slow downs before completion. For example:\n- create one scheduled rule that performs some activities\n- create a second scheduled rule that runs at some point when it is expected the first rule has completed, and then complete the dependent activities\n2.

Recently I have been learning how to build out the backend of a company managed project -- all schemes, workflows, etc. I built out everything for this project in my sandbox environment first and it all seemed to work. I built out all schemes and workflows in production, assigned the schemes, but not the workflows (yet) to the active project, and all of the issues in the project became unassigned.

And, 2) Could someone give me the steps that I need to take when I do this sort of configuration change to active company-managed projects in the future?

Awesome that you're learning and using a sandbox - that's a great start!\nThe issue you ran into with issues becoming unassigned when you changed schemes can happen if the new permission scheme or workflow scheme conflicts with existing assignments.\nHere are some examples:\n- Permission Scheme: Let's say your old permission scheme allowed anyone in the \"developers\" group to be assigned to issues. But your new scheme only lets project admins be assigned. When you switch schemes, any issues assigned to developers who aren't project admins might become unassigned.\n- Workflow Scheme: Imagine your old workflow had a status called \"In Progress\" where anyone could be assigned. Your new workflow replaces \"In Progress\" with two new statuses: \"Technical Review\" (only developers can be assigned) and \"Design Review\" (only designers can be assigned). If an issue was \"In Progress\" and assigned to someone who's neither a developer nor a designer, it might become unassigned when the new workflow is applied.Here's the approach I generally take for changes:\n- Plan and test thoroughly in a sandbox environment.\n- Think about how the schemes I'm changing might affect each other.\n- Minimise disruption by making small, iterative changes or rolling them out gradually.This free learning path from Atlassian University is a great resource too: https://university.atlassian.com/student/path/1928323-streamline-projects-across-jira-with-shared-configurations\nHope this helps!","comments":[]}],"tags":["cloud","company-managed-projects","jira-cloud","projects","schemes","workflows"],"url":"https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-questions/What-are-the-proper-steps-to-switch-schemes-and-workflows-in-an/qaq-p/2758745"}

For example: project = \"XXXX\" ORDER BY priority DESC, created DESC, \"Difficulty Level\" DESC (This sorts by priority, then creation date, then difficulty level, within the project \"XXXX\"). Remember to replace \"XXXX\" with your actual project name/key!\n- Add a \"Filter Results\" gadget to a dashboard: Configure the gadget to use your filter In the gadget settings, set the \"Number of results\" to 3Now your dashboard will show only the top 3 tickets based on your custom sort.\nHope this helps!","comments":[{"author":"Lior Diamant","body":"Thanks for the quick response, Seon!\nThat does help. Is there a way to create a more advance formula for sorting? say \"ticket_age_in_hours + (difficulty_level * 3) + (priority_level * 4)\""},{"author":"Seon Shakespeare","body":"Hi @Lior Diamant,\nYou should be able to achieve this using a Jira filter and a dashboard gadget!\nHere's an example JQL query you can use:\n- Create a Jira filter using this JQL.\n- Add a \"Filter Results\" gadget to your dashboard and configure it to use your filter.Remember:\n- Replace \"XXXX\" with your project key.\n- You might need to adjust the values for \"Difficulty Level\" and \"priority\" to match the options available in your Jira instance.\n- Adjust the created clause if needed.For more details on using JQL (Jira's search language), check out this helpful documentation:\nhttps://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/what-is-advanced-search-in-jira-cloud/\nIf my answers have helped feel free to mark my comment as the accepted solution, so others can find it easily.

I am testing out Confluence Databases to see if they could be useful for us and am running into some serious issues.\nSome context: Our company has traditionally stored a ton of data in various Excel sheets, but I think that most of this data could be migrated to Confluence via the new Databases feature. For example: One of the worksheets I am trying to migrate has all of our project codes stored in it. We have a few different clients and want some way to view the project codes related to those clients. Should be pretty easy, right?\nMy solution: I was thinking of building out a larger Confluence Database that holds all of the project codes for all clients, similar to how they are in the Excel file. What I wanted to do was create different \"custom views\" filtered by the different clients. I could then embed these custom views onto different pages within Confluence so people would not have to go through and search for the ones they need.\nThe problem(s): I cannot get the filters OR the custom views to work properly!\nFirst: When I apply the filter, it is not giving me all of the results it should. It shows just a couple of results, and I do not know why the rest are filtered out. Is there a limit t o the number of rows that a filter can show?\nSecond: Some of the entries don't even follow the filter rules! I am getting results that clearly do not adhere to the filter specifications.\nThird: Whenever I go to save the custom view, the filter ends up clearing the text field. I create the filter, click \"Update View for Everyone\", and when I click into another view and come back the filter looks like this:\n\nIdk why I am having so many issues with these. I understand that Databases are still in Beta, but these are some basic features that should be easy to configure.

{"question":{"author":"MAURON Robin","title":"Link 1 ticket generated from an automation to another project, then follow the progress of the gener","body":"Good morning !\nRecently, our infrastructure domain has had 2 request portals for a fire protection part (Pi), and an access control part (SALTO). Having a very specific collaboration between our two services, we wish to do the following:\n- (Resolved) When a ticket is transited (SALTO), create a ticket to the other portal (Pi).\n- (Unresolved) When the ticket generated at Pi is updated, commented, updated, or other, put a comment in the trigger ticket (SALTO).\n- And vice versa.\nHow can I go about it? It's possible ?\nI've done a lot of research, but I can't find anything.\n\nThanks in advance !\n\nBeautiful day :)"},"answers":[{"author":"Trudy Claspill","body":"Hello @MAURON Robin\nWelcome to the Atlassian community.\nYou can accomplish those requirements with Automation Rules.\nBut first we need some clarification.\nWhat do the prefixes \"(Resolved)\" and \"(Unresolved)\" mean in points 1 and 2? Do you mean you have already solved point 1, but need help resolving point 2?\nYou need to describe #3 more precisely. To which of the above (1, or 2, or both 1 and 2) does \"vice versa\" apply? Also, what exactly is in scope when you say the Pi issue is \"updated\"? There are a lot of changes that could be made to an issue. Exactly which ones would you want to copy?\nJira Administrators can create Automation Rules. They may also grant that permission to additional users.\nIn the Automation Rules page there is a Templates tab where you may find a template that is the same as your requirement or close to it. For instance your #1 is close to this template:\n\nThough instead of using the Clone action you might want to use the Create Issue action.\n\nYou can find more example rules here:\nhttps://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/automation-template-library#/rule-list?systemLabelId=all&page=1&pageSize=20&sortKey=name&sortOrder=ASC\n\nRegarding #2, in order to have changes in one issue be copied into another issue, there will have to be a way to identify the other issue. One way to do that is to have an Issue Link between the two issues. You do have to consider whether or not there might be multiple issue links between the changed issue and other issues, and then which of the other issues should be updated.\nAdditionally, because such a rule would be triggered by changes in one project, but updating issues in another project, the rule would have to be a multiple-project scoped rule. Only Jira Administrators can create such rules.\n\nIf you need additional information, please let us know and we can provide more detail.","comments":[{"author":"MAURON Robin","body":"Good morning !\nThank you for your reply !\n\nYes, point #1 has been resolved on my side. These are points no. 2 and 3 which are still pending.\nIndeed, when I talk about \"vise et versa\", I mean that an update in the SALTO project should result in an update of the ticket in the PI project, and vice versa.\nRegarding point #2, I thought about discerning the points I wanted to identify. However, I think it would be interesting if when a ticket (exemple : SALTO-56) is updated (whether it's a state transition, comment, edit or otherwise), it creates an internal comment in the cloned PI ticket from SALTO-56.\nSo, by proceeding in this way, the technicians of my team can know when the work of the PI project has evolved, thanks to a simple automatic comment. Of course, it would be the same for the other team owning the PI project.\n\nTo conclude, our company is taking these first steps into the Atlassian universe and my SALTO project is the first project of the company that will see the light of day. The PI project is the second (under development). We already have an IT HelpDesk but this was done by teams external to our company. So, I am self-taught in this project and the administrators learn at the same time as me (knowing that my job is badge access control management, and not IT). This is why I come directly to the community to ask my question. Because it's a brand new project in addition to my daily work.\n\nThanks again for your help, it’s very kind of you! :D\nBeautiful day !\nPS: In the appendix, a screenshot of the 2 projects to understand what I'm talking about when I talk about SALTO and PI.\nI am the administrator of these 2 projects."},{"author":"Trudy Claspill","body":"What do you want the comment to say?\nWill there ever be more than one clone link between a SALTO issue and a PI issue?\nBoth of the projects are Service Management projects. Those are typically used to manage \"support\" issues and enable limited communication with \"customers\" who are not licensed user of your Jira environment. Is that the intended use of these projects?\nIn Service Management projects Comments can be either Internal Only or Customer Visible. Which do you want these comments to be?\nThere are so many ways that an issue can be updated. Depending on what you want your comments to include you may need multiple rules to handle everything. For example:\nDo you want the original value and the new value?\nSingle user picker fields like Reporter and Assignee: do you want the user name, account id, or email?\nMultiple selection fields (list, check boxes, and fields like Request participants, Components, Labels, and Version fields) can be updated both to remove multiple values and add new values.\nLinks to other issues can be added and removed. What information would you hope to include about the other issues?\nChild Issues can be added and removed.\nAn issue can be moved from one Parent to another, get a Parent for the first time, or be be disconnected from any parent.\nWork can be logged against issues.\nWork logs and Comments can be edited or removed.\nAttachments can be added and removed.\nAnd issue can be permanently deleted.\nThere is no singular Automation Rules construct that can handle all of these cases.\nI think you need to take another look at your intention and think deeply about the real problem you are trying to solve, and whether or not the implementation you are considering will actually add value.\nPerhaps instead of copying information between the issues, a simpler solution would be for team members in each project to Watch the issues of interest in the other project. Then the native Notification configuration could be used to send change notifications to the individuals that care about the issue. Or give each team the ability to view the issues in the other team's project."}]}],"tags":["cloud","jira-cloud"],"url":"https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-questions/Link-1-ticket-generated-from-an-automation-to-another-project/qaq-p/2758428"}

I recall testing it several years ago and found it inconsistently worked with Cloud; IMO it probably should throw an error as it is unsupported.\nAnd so, that is what caused the difference with the square brackets: the plural smart value detected possible nested lists (i.e., version lists within an issue list) and so added brackets around the nested list.\nI have updated my earlier post accordingly."}]}],"tags":["cloud","jira-cloud"],"url":"https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-questions/Automation-ADD-quot-earliestUnreleasedVersion-quot-to-fixVersion/qaq-p/2758269"}

My macro successfully retrieves user-defined JQL and issue fields, processes them on the backend, and aims to publish the resulting data within the Jira Issues macro format. However, I am encountering difficulty in locating the essential macro ID required for embedding the data into the Jira Issues macro. As of my research, I have found no accessible API endpoint to retrieve this macro ID programmatically. Could someone from the community kindly provide guidance or suggestions on how to obtain this macro ID effectively?

For example if I want to be able to get management reports on a category of lets say REPORTING. Would it be best to set up an EPIC called REPORTING and then every time we have a request to do with a new report or amending an existing report in our accounting system, we add a User Story (in which case it would be a continious EPIC) or would it be best to have a category field where when I get a request for a report I can set up an EPIC and categorise it to REPORTING and then get stats out on just REPORTING work."},"answers":[{"author":"Seon Shakespeare","body":"Hey @Linda Visagie,\nWelcome to the community!\nGreat question! Both Epics and custom fields can work for recurring requests, but here's my take:\nEpics:\n- What's an Epic? It's basically a big, overarching work item that represents a large body of work. Think of it like a container for a bunch of related user stories.\n- Easy to set up. Just create an Epic like \"REPORTING\" and link all your report requests to it. Done!\n- Nice and visual. You can use Epics as swimlanes on your Kanban board to group those requests.\n- But... they can get huge and messy over time. Plus, reporting on specific types of reports within that giant Epic can be a pain. And, you may need to create a new Epic for each project.Custom Category Fields:\n- More flexible. You can filter, create reports, and even build a dashboard to track all your reporting requests across multiple projects.\n- Downside: You'll need to do a bit of admin to set up the custom field and add it to all the relevant screens to make sure everyone uses it consistently.So, which one should you pick?\n- Epics are great if you love visual organisation and are mostly working within one project.\n- Custom fields are the way to go if you need powerful reporting and want a consistent approach across multiple projects.Hope this helps!","comments":[{"author":"Linda Visagie","body":"Thank you very much Sean that is really helpful.

Unfortunately I'm struggling with checking whether this issue in Project B exists and thus the automation is always creating a new Issue. My desired behaviour is that the automation detects \"oh there's already an Issue with this name\" and links it instead of creating issues.

Once you enter your working calendar into the app, it takes your working schedule into account too. That is, \"In Progress\" time of an issue opened on Friday at 5 PM and closed on Monday at 9 AM, will be a few hours rather than 3 days.\n- You can set different duration formats.\n- You can export reports in CSV file format and open them in MS Excel.\n- You can also add this app as a gadget to your Jira dashboards and reach “Status Time” from Issue Detail page.\n- You can enable/disable access to Status Time reports&gadgets and Issue Detail page per project, users, groups or project role.If you are looking for a completely free solution, you can try the limited version Status Time Reports Free.\nIf you have any questions, feel free to schedule a demo with us.\nHope it helps.","comments":[]},{"author":"Valeriia_Havrylenko_SaaSJet","body":"Hi @thumuluru_shreya 👋\nWelcome to the Community!

The link wasn't working until the projects were migrated by the copy data tool, but once it finished, it worked without any issues when clicking on the link as well.\nSo far, it seems to be working as expected! :D\nIf this didn't work at first, I'd try the Jira repair tool in the Confluence Settings to see if it would fix any issues too.\nFor the Jira macro (not the legacy one), it seems it doesn't automatically do this change and it is necessary to edit the macro and update the site from where the JQL or project you have previously set, otherwise it will display the jira issues from the site it was configured previously.\nBut for links added to the page with the Jira link, not the macro, it works without any issues and doesn't need to be manually updated.\nIf you decided to migrate already using the tool and had any issues, or are still planning to migrate and when you do see any issues with those links, please feel free to open a support ticket with us to see any alternatives to help you with that, for any unexpected behaviors.\nCheers, Jessica","comments":[]}],"tags":["cloud","confluence-cloud","jira-cloud","migration"],"url":"https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Confluence-questions/Updating-Jira-links-when-using-Copy-Product-Data/qaq-p/2726127"}

I looked through some of the discussion on this post and wanted to add some additional suggestions/context.\nIf the core problem is that inactive pages are not getting reviewed/updated, the \"for each inactive page\" branch may solve your problem. You can configure it with a timeframe over which it will find pages (up to 150 pages with the current branch limits) that haven't been viewed/updated/commented in that time.\n\nThe \"inactive pages\" branch has the additional benefit that you can use the consolidated {{inactivePages}} smart value after the branch to put every page in a single email. For example, you can use {{inactivePages.url}} to include a list of all the page URLs in your email body. See the documentation for smart values to see more advanced formatting options https://support.atlassian.com/cloud-automation/docs/smart-values-in-jira-automation/\nSpoiler alert, we're planning to add this consolidated smart value output to all of our branches soon!\nIf the \"inactive pages\" branch isn't what you want, we also have the \"Lookup pages\" action which has the same configuration options as the normal page branch.

{"question":{"author":"Karin van Driel","title":"Description field in Jira macro in Confluence doesn't wrap","body":"We are trying to create Release notes in Confluence for our business folks, based on the detailed descriptions we capture on our parent issues in Jira, by using the Release notes template. We are creating full descriptions in Jira, several paragraphs long. All the text is coming through, but it is only wrapping at hard returns, keeping all the text in a paragraph on a single line. This is causing the release notes not to be a nice, single read page, but rather gives us a table where users are forced to scroll. We would like to export to PDF or Word, but unfortunately this is also not working, due to the width of the table on the page. Is there a way to force the wrapping of the text?

{"question":{"author":"Brandon Garrett","title":"Want to have an automated email send information about a linked(parent issue), double nested","body":"Hey, This seems like a complicated one, at least to me: I currently have an automation that fires off and works great, but would like it to do additional reporting. Basically, I want it to be able to push out a smart value reading of the parent of the parent. Here is the basic setup: -We have a Board (Called Projects) that is the parent board for another board where the projects are broken up (The \"child\" board is called Agency) -When Epics are created in the Project board a secondary issue is created and linked to them on the Agency board. -The Agency board represents the work that is actually being done whereas the project board just tracks the completion of the overarching project. -Because of this we have notifications sent out to our sales team when chunks of work get completed on the Agency board. Right now, the Automation correctly Identifies the parent of the subtask in the agency board when sending the email. **What I want to do** I want the current automation that sends off to ALSO identify the Parent from the Project board that is linked to the Agency board. The link classification is currently parent. Here is what I have for my current automation (maybe its as simple as my smart values being wrong): https://imgur.com/a/THZryuG The highlighted ones output nothing. Here is the email I receive: https://imgur.com/a/DERH8Cc And finally, here is the ticket in question to prove that it does have a parent linked.\nhttps://imgur.com/a/wDgIiIi\nBTW, yes, I do have the rule set to apply to BOTH of the boards in question, it exists in global automation rather than being attached to one board.\n\nThis whole thing may be a simple syntax error. The automation works great aside from not being able to show the parent of parent. Thanks in advance for your help!"},"answers":[{"author":"Trudy Claspill","body":"Hello @Brandon Garrett\nThe first problem with your email is your reference to {{createdIssue}}. That is used to refer to an issue that is created within the executing Automation rule. Your rule is not creating any issues.\nSecond, your references to {{issue.parent}} in the email would all be attempting to reference the parent of your sub-task's parent issue. In the branch you have change the focus of the rule to the parent of the sub-task. So within the branch {{issue}} will be referring to the parent of the sub-task.\nThird, in your email references to {{issue.parent.epic}} doesn't get POCBP-744 for two reasons.\n- First, in that context {{issue}} is referring to the parent issue of the sub-task. If you wanted to refer to the sub-task's parent issue's Epic at that point in the rule you would use simply {{issue.parent}}.\n- However, the second reason the reference wouldn't work is because you have used generic issue linking to connect the sub-task's parent to the related Epic. The reference you have used will work only if the Parent field in the sub-task's parent is updated to the key (POCBP-744) of the Epic. This also impacts your reference {{triggerIssue.parent.epic.summary}}Is there a specific reason you are using generic issue linking rather than updating the Parent field?\n\nThe best way to fix this would be\n1. Update the Parent field of the sub-task's parent issue to POCBP-744\n2. To reference the subtask in the email use {{triggerIssue}}\n3. To reference the parent of the sub-task in the email use {{issue}}\n4. To reference POCBP-744 (the \"grandparent\" of the sub-task) in the email use {{issue.parent}}","comments":[{"author":"Brandon Garrett","body":"Trudy, Thank you so much for your reply. Gives me lots to think about. Your second bullet point gets to the core of the issue. I had figured our linking from grandparent to parent was problematic in the past and it makes more sense why, now that I am reading your feedback. I will have to do some work in revamping our linkages across the two boards and test your proposed solution. I will report back when I have had a chance to do so. Thanks again!"},{"author":"Brandon Garrett","body":"Noticing a comment you made on a previous thread: \"If you are using Team Managed projects, those don't allow you to specify parent/child relationships between issues in different projects.\" Since we are on a Team Managed Project for both of these boards in question, that sounds like it will not be possible to make the actual parent child relationships that you are suggesting in your solution. Is that correct? If I was on a company managed project, it sounds like this would be possible, yes? Thanks"},{"author":"Trudy Claspill","body":"Correct - if either one of the projects is Team Managed, the parent Epic and child issue must be in the same project.\nCorrect - if both projects where Company Managed, then the parent Epic and child issue can be in different projects.\nHowever, if you are considering trying to change to Company Managed projects, that comes with its own set of challenges.\nSo, let us assume you are not going to change your projects and we are therefore forced to work with the generic linking to identify the parent Epic.\nThere are some clarifying questions I need to ask.\n- Would you ever have a more than one \"is child of\" link on an issue? What would you want to do in that case?\n- What if there is no \"is child of\" link at all? What would you want to do in that case?\n- What information are you trying to add to the email?

Parent refers to the parent of the subtask Epic refers to the issue Parent is linked to by \"is child of\""},{"author":"Brandon Garrett","body":"Thanks again for a thoughtful and helpful response. 1) Yes, we do have multiple Epics linked to Parents (that are on the other board) 1) In that case, I would want all Epics to be included in the email notification. 2) If there is no Epic attached to the Parent, it would be fine for the email to just have a blank space in there. 3) In this situation 1) Subtask refers to type of data 2) Parent refers to Source of Data 3) Epic refers to the Client we are doing the data gathering/analysis for So the end result of the email would say something like \"Salary Data(subtask) for Data Source(Parent) has been completed for the following Clients (Epic)\" Hope that helps clarify. I included a screenshot to illustrate an example for #1 https://imgur.com/a/bdRZVYu In this example the automation would fire off when subtask POCBA 1632 was marked as complete, and the email would include the information about the Parent, POCBA-1631 and all of the Epics, POCBP-30 etc. I did verify that I cannot make the connection between the POCBA and POCBP board as per the company vs. team managed feedback. Thanks again!"},{"author":"Trudy Claspill","body":"Since your Parent and Epic issues exist in different projects you will have to create this rule from the Global Automations screen. You will have to set the Scope to Multiple Projects and you will have to set Projects to all the projects that could be involved.\nYou may want to add a Condition after the Trigger to proceed only if Project = POCBA, so that the rule will proceed only if the subtask was in the expected project.\nA rule like this should work. (Ignore the issue types I've specified. Use the values you are already using.)\n\nIn the above I am using a Lookup Issues action with a JQL statement to get all the Epics that are linked by the \"is child of\" link to the parent of the subtask that triggered the rule. Here are some reference relevant to that:\nhttps://support.atlassian.com/cloud-automation/docs/jira-automation-actions/#Lookup-issues\nhttps://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/jql-functions/#linkedIssues--\n\n\nIn the above there are three sections to the email content.\nIn section 1 you print information from the subtask. Use {{triggerIssue}} to reference that issue and include any field you want to print from that issue. Of course you need a separate smart value for each field.\nIn section 2 you print information about the subtask's parent. Use {{issue}} to reference that issue.\nIn section 3 you are printing information about the Epics linked to Parent. These were obtained in the Lookup Issues action and are contained in a list object referenced by {{lookupIssues}}. Using this syntax\n...tells the system that you want to print information for each issue in the lookupIssues list.\nIn between those two lines you put smart values naming just the fields that you want to print. So you would say {{key}} to print the issue key, {{Summary}} to print the issue Summary, and so on.

{"question":{"author":"Ryan Lawson","title":"How to restrict user to view tickets assigned to a specific team","body":"Hi all! We have a dozen teams (we utilize a Team dropdown field in the ticket to assign) that place our tickets into one large project. This project is used to house tickets for many clients as it is a core product.\nThe issue is that we want our client to see the only tickets for their epics, stories, bugs etc but we cannot allow them to see the tickets for other clients.\nMy ask is this: can we limit 1 client to view ONLY tickets assigned to 1 specific team? If so how?\n\nThanks!"},"answers":[{"author":"Trudy Claspill","body":"Hello @Ryan Lawson\nWelcome to the Atlassian community.\nWhat type of project are you using? You can get that information from the Type column on the View All Projects page under the Projects menu.\nFor Company Managed Software and Business projects there is a feature called Issue Security Schemes (available only in paid subscriptions). You can use that to define who can see issues based on their membership in a project role, or user group, or other factors. Unfortunately Team is not one of the factors that can be used, and the feature doesn't have a way to correlate a user to a Team.\nHow do you identify that an individual is a member of a specific \"client\" group? You could create Project Roles or User Groups for each \"client\" group and assign each individual to the appropriate \"client\" Role or User Group. You could then use the Issue Security Scheme feature to create Security Levels that for each client group that enable visibility to a client group plus all the internal team members.

{"question":{"author":"Anton","title":"Migrate from team to company-based and preserve Keys","body":"Hi, I changed the keys of my team-managed projects; I observed that the issue keys also changed. I'm trying to create a new company-managed project with the original project key so that I can migrate the issues of the old team-managed project. However, I can not use the original project key which I need to use for consistency. I thought maybe there are some processes running in the background after the renaming, but two days later nothing has changed. By renaming the key, I am assuming that the key should become available again which is a logical consequence. When trying to create a new company-managed project with the original key, I'm getting the error message that a team-managed project already has the given key; however, when opening the project settings, it doesn't.\nTherefore, there is a huge inconsistency between what is communicated on the UI and what happens in the background, therefore it is non-intuitive what actions I should take to achieve the outcome I want. Any workarounds? Thanks!"},"answers":[{"author":"Max Walther","body":"Hi @Anton ,\n@Marc Koppelaar - Devoteamis right. You can't do it that way.\nYou could however use an .csv export of the old project, delete it and try to import the issues in the new company managed project.\nI'm certain you wont get the same issue keys, but at least you'll have the same Project Key.\nWhy do you need the exact issue keys in your new project?\nCheers\nMax","comments":[{"author":"Anton","body":"That sounds indeed like a good workaround.\nWe are using issue keys as actual references to user stories in documents and conversations, internal and external.

So, you pick that attribute from the dropdown list and then instead of putting in a value, you leave it blank. You can see that the field is blank, it says “the attribute will be cleared”, and so that is promising.\n\nIt works great when the attribute is already set to a value in the object. But when the attribute is already empty you will see messages in the rule log like “Objects were skipped” and “Error updating Object(s)” and overall Automation Rule will also fail.\nI think the behavior should be that it not error.\n\nThe workaround available for me is that I check the value of the existing attribute in JSM Assets and only then “set” (clear) the value.

{"question":{"author":"Mischke_ Mona","title":"Workaround needed - Subtasks on Kanban Board / Due Date Management","body":"Hello everyone,\nPerhaps I should say by way of introduction that I am very dissatisfied with the functionality of the business project that I have selected. In case of doubt, it was a momentous mistake to select \"Business Project\" instead of \"Software Project\" - even if it is more of a business project.\nUnfortunately, I have already invested two weeks in setting up the project - so I definitely don't have the time to set up the project again as a software project and a simple migration doesn't seem to be possible either?\n\nSo now to my specific question:\nI'm wondering how to use the Kanban board, which is provided in the business project, in a meaningful way if the sub-tasks are firmly attached to the tasks. I have stored sub-tasks for many tasks and these also have a status (by default!). My Kanban board is organised according to the different statuses and I have also added one called \"due soon\" and implemented a rule that pushes all issues to the status whose due date is only three days away.\n\nHowever, the problem is that the sub-tasks are not listed individually on the Kanban board. This means that an issue is in status X and it is not at all clear that a number of sub-tasks below it are perhaps in the status \"due soon\" or even in a completely different status. To do this, I would simply have to manually go into all the tasks on the entire board and have a look at the sub-tasks --> That can't be the point. How did you solve this? Or do you not work with sub-tasks at all? Or do they never get their own status?\n\nI'm a bit frustrated at the moment because I thought I had found the tool in Jira that would provide me with optimal support for a large project and I've now put so much work into it, but I'm still coming up against limits (that I somehow can't understand). It looks like I'll still have to keep a to-do list of what I have to do and when, but that's exactly what I wanted to avoid and finally get everything in one place.\n\nBut maybe other users have a tip how to sole my problem? Or maybe I just oversee functionalities or use them in a wrong way?"},"answers":[{"author":"Mischke_ Mona","body":"Hey, just wanted to let you know, that I found a workaround thanks to a nice Jira User here!

Leider ist es gesperrt aber es ist nicht zu erkennen warum? Wir verwenden jira in der Cloud.\nI have already found out that it is not possible to unlock the field. But how can I find out why it is locked?"},"answers":[{"author":"Seon Shakespeare","body":"Hi @Lukas Eickhoff,\nYep, the \"Rank\" field is locked. This is intentional!\nHere's why:\n- Automatic Ranking: Jira uses the \"Rank\" field to manage the order of issues in your backlog and on boards. It automatically updates this field when you drag and drop issues to reorder them.\n- Preventing Conflicts: Locking the field prevents manual edits that could conflict with Jira's automatic ranking system. This ensures that the order of your issues always reflects the intended priority and workflow.Think of it this way: the \"Rank\" field is like a behind-the-scenes mechanism that Jira uses to keep everything organised. It's not meant for direct user manipulation.\nIf you want to change the order of your issues, use the drag-and-drop functionality on your backlog or boards.\nHope this helps!","comments":[]}],"tags":["cloud","jira-cloud"],"url":"https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-questions/Field-is-locked/qaq-p/2756888"}

The idea is that specific tasks can be tracked in project XYZ without flooding the management with standard PM tasks in project ABC.\nIn project ABC I created an Epic with the same name as project XYZ and linked this Epic to all the Epics from the second project to track progress. When I look at my timeline I see all the epics from project ABC with their tasks and sub-tasks and a small progress bar.

You can see more details about how to do it here. For a section to be conditional, the preceding field must be a radio, checkbox, or dropdown field.\n- You can use the toolbar at the top to add elements, like tables, columns, information boxes, and more.\n- To see what your form looks like, and test any conditional logic and validation, select Preview.\n- You can add a form to the portal form for a request type by following the steps described in this document.\n- When you're finished building your form, select Save changes.You can see more details about Forms in the documentation below:\n- Use forms in Jira Service ManagementIf you have any other questions regarding this matter, please let us know.","comments":[]}],"tags":["cloud","jira-service-management","jira-service-management-cloud"],"url":"https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-questions/Display-Specific-Field-Values-Based-on-Another-Field-Value/qaq-p/2756362"}

Ideally, I'd love to have a single point of reference for all my tasks. Ideally I want to work from one project and have that project pull in tasks from another project into the backlog and the sprint. What's the recommended way to accomplish this? Also, how does team vs company-wide projects affect this?"},"answers":[{"author":"Trudy Claspill","body":"Hello @Jean-Mark Wright\nWelcome to the Atlassian community.\nAn issue exists in one and only one project at a time. So you can't \"pull in\" to your project issues that exist in another project. You could make a copy of the original issue with that copy being in your project, but then those are two separate issues that can be changed independently of each other.\nIt is possible to create a Scrum board that pulls information from multiple projects. That sounds like what you need.\nYou would create and save a filter that selects all the issues that you want to include in your Scrum board.\nYou would then create the Scrum board based on the saved filter.\nNote that issues can also be in only one planned or active sprint at a time. So if the other project is managing the same issue in a sprint you cannot put it in a sprint of your own.\nRegarding your question about Team vs. Company Managed projects and the impact of those...\nCompany Managed projects and Team Managed projects use two different fields for story points; Company Managed projects use the \"Story points\" field while Team Managed projects use the field \"Story point estimate\". If you are estimating based on story points you can't combine that information from the different project times in a single Scrum board. A Scrum board created from a saved filter would reflect only the \"Story points\" data from Company Managed project issues in Scrum reports that are based on story points.\nAnother difference is that Team Managed projects have their own distinct Status values in the workflow. Even if both the Team Managed project and the Company Managed project issues use a status named \"Done\", those are different statuses in the underlying database. So you have to make sure to map all the statuses to columns correctly, and reports that roll up statistics based on issue status would reflect those as different statistics.\nAdditionally a Team Managed project can't have multiple boards linked to it. The Location of the extra board could be set to a Company Managed project, or your profile, but not the Team Managed project.\nThose are some of the impacts of combining information from two such projects in one board.","comments":[]}],"tags":["cloud","jira-cloud"],"url":"https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-questions/Consolidating-work-from-multiple-projects-into-sprints-and/qaq-p/2756225"}

First off, I downloaded the XML of all workflows in use and looked for the property \"editable\" and sure enough it turned up in one of the workflows. However, initially I discounted the default Jira workflows which wasted my time initially. Someone added an Epic into a sprint and then Closed it as all the underlying ticket were complete. It isn't standard practice for us to set the Sprint for an Epic as it is the stories within that go into the sprints. The reason this causes the problem is by default, Epics use the default Jira \"System\" workflow and the \"Closed\" status on this workflow has the property mentioned above.\nBeing a default Jira \"System\" workflow means it is not editable. So to solve this I had to re-open the Epic, remove the sprint value from the epic and then close the Epic again. I was then able to close the sprint. Hope this might help someone in future.","comments":[{"author":"Andrey Ivanov","body":"Thank you very much, I will take your advice and write back later"},{"author":"Andrey Ivanov","body":"Hi, unfortunately it didn't work"}]}],"tags":["cloud","jira-service-management","jira-service-management-cloud"],"url":"https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-questions/Trying-to-close-a-sprint/qaq-p/2756196"}

{"question":{"author":"Leons Gumba","title":"Granting watching options to specific users in Jira","body":"Hi everyone! So here's the situation. We have a Compliance Jira project in our cloud instance, and it has pretty strict permission rules. Basically, only the members of the Compliance department group can access this project, create issues in it, leave comments, etc. But now they have reached out to me and told me that they have created a few new issues and they need input from some people from other departments, and those people obviously don't have access to the Compliance project as I stated before. They can't see the project and can't see those issues but they are expected to work on them. What is the best way to grant permissions to those users from outside of the Compliance department so that they can only access those issues where their input is needed? I can't add them as Watchers because they don't have the \"Browse Projects\" permission. And if I grant them that permission, all of the issues will be open to them, which the Compliance team obviously wants to avoid. How do I manage this?"},"answers":[{"author":"Mikael Sandberg","body":"You need to implement an issue security scheme with two levels, one that allows users not from the compliance team to view and comment on specific issues and the second one that is set on issues that only the compliance team should have access to. Once you applied the security levels to all issues you need to open up the project so the external users can browse and at least comment on issues. By doing this the external users will have access to the project, but will only see issues that have the external security level set on them. Have a look at this KB for more information.","comments":[{"author":"Leons Gumba","body":"@Mikael Sandberg hey there! Thank you very much for your response! So, let's play out a scenario right here. Let's say there are currently 100 issues in the Compliance project. 10 of those need input from people outside the Compliance department. I need to create 2 issue security levels like you said, right? One for the Compliance team only and another that includes both the Compliance team and the external group. Then, I need to bulk change all the issues and apply the first security level to the 90 internal issues and the second level to the 10 external issues? Am I getting it right? And after that I also need to grant those external users the \"Browse Project\" and \"Add Comment\" permissions like you mentioned."},{"author":"Mikael Sandberg","body":"Yes, that is correct. And what you can do in the issue security scheme is set the internal level as the default and then on the issues that need external input you can manually change the security level."},{"author":"Leons Gumba","body":"@Mikael Sandberg amazing, thank you!
